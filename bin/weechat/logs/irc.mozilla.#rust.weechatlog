2019-01-25 09:01:27	mib_w0qieb	Out of curiosity, seeing the new const-function rules, I tried creating a const function or macro that will take a number n and return an array (or a vector) containing the first n integers. 0..n.
2019-01-25 09:01:38	mib_w0qieb	Three hours later, I'm all out of ideas.
2019-01-25 09:02:27	Mutabah	That would require const generics

2019-01-25 09:05:27	mib_w0qieb	So THAT's why the recursion never terminated?
2019-01-25 09:06:37	jebrosen	You can't match "0" in the recursion because "0" is not the same as "3 - 1 - 1 - 1"

2019-01-25 09:10:12	Mutabah	Nah, it's the name for a form of macro_rules macro that does some trickery to form a nearly fully-fledged parser
2019-01-25 09:10:21	jebrosen	mib_w0qieb: You could definitely do  it with a procedural macro, but expansion to an expression is an unstable nightly feature. A procedural macro that generated a constant item would work, though

2019-01-25 09:47:59	wyvern	I'm trying to have travis test that fuzzers at least *build* by running them for 1 second. However, when travis runs `cargo fuzz list`, the names are prefixed with some gremlin characters like this: no bin target named `(B[m[32mroundtrip_no_pad`. See https://travis-ci.org/alicemaz/rust-base64/jobs/482014128. When I run the shell commands that travis is running locally, they work great. Anyone know how to address this?

2019-01-25 09:53:37	jeikobu	stephaneyfx: Yeah, ok.  Bummer, in my actual case what mutates and what is returned are related and I wanted to avoid the logic block in the caller (or repeating the logic).  Thank you though
2019-01-25 09:53:51	jeikobu	Am I right in thinking it's sound, i.e., something the borrow checker might allow some day?

2019-01-25 09:58:07	matiu	How does one make a vector of closures?
2019-01-25 09:58:34	jeikobu	Ehh, hrrmm.  Still doesn't like it when I move my logic to the caller.  Guess I'll... try pulling inner out of the struct or something.
2019-01-25 09:58:38	Moongoodboy{K}	matiu: That's a bit tricky. Closures each have their own unique, anonymous types.
2019-01-25 09:58:41	wyvern	On my (color enabled) shell `cargo fuzz list` doesn't output color
2019-01-25 09:58:55	wyvern	If I pipe it through `hexdump` it is clearly producing only the expected ascii
2019-01-25 09:59:00	Moongoodboy{K}	matiu: The easiest case is when none of the closures capture anything—in that case, their anonymous types can be coerced to simple `fn`s
2019-01-25 09:59:04	stephaneyfx	jeikobu: I think there was a post explaining why it behaves this way and that it was not planned to change it. I'm still looking for it...
