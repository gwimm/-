2019-01-24 21:12:29	re101-fox-724	@digitok ok I understood, I'm pulling the text from the FSO by ReadAll, somewhere there I need to remove all the newlines, and convert the pulled text to a one-liner so that the regexp works
2019-01-24 21:13:05	re101-fox-724	@digitok would be nice though if I could just replace (?s) with something vbs friendly o.O
2019-01-24 21:13:36	digitok	i mean
2019-01-24 21:13:38	digitok	did you read the manual?
2019-01-24 21:14:01	re101-fox-724	manual of?

2019-01-24 21:15:29	grr12314	re101-eel-756 regexes dont "print" things, thats done in whatever programming language you use after applying the regex. if you don't know how to access capture groups in your language, then say that, along with needed details like what that language is.
2019-01-24 21:15:53	digitok	ok i checked and vbscript has no 's' flag option
2019-01-24 21:15:57	re101-fox-724	I'm on it, if that's what you meant :)) but you know, there must be something to use instead of (?s)
2019-01-24 21:16:06	digitok	in that case, use [\S\s] in place of . in your patterns
2019-01-24 21:16:47	re101-fox-724	well the problem was solved when I remove (?s), the dots didn't break it

2019-01-24 21:22:20	re101-fox-724	when I replace the dot with [\S\s], then I don't need (?s) beforehand anymore
2019-01-24 21:22:24	re101-fox-724	is it correct?
2019-01-24 21:23:10	digitok	right
2019-01-24 21:23:15	digitok	so .*? -> [\S\s]*?
2019-01-24 21:23:28	digitok	\S non-spaces, \s spaces
2019-01-24 21:23:37	re101-fox-724	yup!
2019-01-24 21:23:56	re101-fox-724	weirdly, I didn't need to replace the other .* I had
2019-01-24 21:24:49	re101-fox-724	apparently when there's no (?s) beforehand it doesn't break o.O
2019-01-24 21:25:13	re101-fox-724	or?
2019-01-24 21:25:48	digitok	the (?s) is what breaks the pattern because vbscript doesn't support it
2019-01-24 21:25:57	digitok	do you know what (?s) is for?
2019-01-24 21:26:12	re101-fox-724	apparently not :))
2019-01-24 21:26:45	digitok	ok so by default, the special char `.` matches any character EXCEPT for \n (newlines)
2019-01-24 21:26:54	digitok	(?s) flag/modifier simply tells . to also match \n

2019-01-24 21:26:56	re101-fox-724	jup
2019-01-24 21:27:34	digitok	so a workaround is to use two character class shorthands like \S\s or \W\w \D\d etc etc
2019-01-24 21:27:43	digitok	since that effectively matchs every char including \n

2019-01-24 22:40:02	+up|ime	try [^\/]+ instead of (.*)
2019-01-24 22:40:05	digitok	change .* to [^\/]+
2019-01-24 22:40:08	digitok	meh

2019-01-24 22:40:35	Caz	Way better
2019-01-24 22:40:39	+up|ime	would still work, just not capture it :P
2019-01-24 22:40:45	Caz	I'll try in my groovy script
2019-01-24 22:40:49	digitok	!zarthus
2019-01-24 22:40:49	+up|ime	and maybe his capturing group is irrelevant!

2019-01-24 22:41:01	+up|ime	the regex works tho
2019-01-24 22:41:09	+up|ime	just not according to his potentially wanted wants.
2019-01-24 22:41:15	digitok	that's the key!
2019-01-24 22:41:27	+up|ime	I trust people to be somewhat smart and figure it out.
2019-01-24 22:41:33	+up|ime	but maybe it'll work even better if he didn't need a CG at all!
2019-01-24 22:42:03	digitok	Caz: fyi, .*? is a "lazy" version of .* (i.e. match until the first \/ vs match until the last \/)
2019-01-24 22:42:14	digitok	so that would also be a solution, however [^\/]+ is faster
2019-01-24 22:43:40	Caz	digitok:  Got this point, I'll stay on the better solution tho'

2019-01-25 01:13:01	dougquaid	I'm writing an android app and it has a setting that can be a URL or IP address of a server. I'd like to detect if the user inputs a URL or IP. If he inputs an IP I will validate that it is a valid IP. I was thinking that I could check if he input an IP rather than a URL if the string has only numbers and . characters, and no letters. What's a good regex for that?

2019-01-25 04:58:11	+JohnDoe2	that's more about character escape rules which are mysql specific
2019-01-25 04:58:48	re101-bongo-826	Tried copying and pasting the various formats, but only the simple ones seem to work in mysql (DBeaver)
2019-01-25 04:58:57	+JohnDoe2	that being said MySQL employs POSIX ERE regex https://www.regular-expressions.info/posix.html#ere
2019-01-25 05:03:27	re101-bongo-826	thanks for the link JohnDoe2. It tells me that the REGEXP functions in MySQL are very (too) limited, and thus you cannot simply copy/paste from regex101 etc.
2019-01-25 05:03:40	+JohnDoe2	sort of
2019-01-25 05:03:59	+JohnDoe2	it's like new functions being added to a programing language that's not extensible by the user
2019-01-25 05:04:26	+JohnDoe2	so you have to use whatever is available in ERE 
2019-01-25 05:04:34	+JohnDoe2	of course, that depends on what you're trying to achieve
2019-01-25 05:05:03	re101-bongo-826	finding pattern for model numbers, strings with certain number of digits and characters.
2019-01-25 05:05:29	+JohnDoe2	that's fairly general
2019-01-25 05:05:50	+JohnDoe2	can you share your regex101 link?
2019-01-25 05:05:57	re101-bongo-826	ok :)
2019-01-25 05:10:05	re101-bongo-826	Example (doesn't work yet): \bm[A-Z]{1-2}[0-9]{1-3}  -> word boundary, starting with m, followed by 1 or 2 a-z, then 1 to 3 digits
2019-01-25 05:10:59	re101-bongo-826	(these are for example the model numbers for Apple products)
2019-01-25 05:13:08	+JohnDoe2	re101-bongo-826 that requires that A-Z be capitalized
2019-01-25 05:13:30	re101-bongo-826	ideally case insensitive
2019-01-25 05:13:39	+JohnDoe2	then switch to [a-zA-Z]
2019-01-25 05:13:46	re101-bongo-826	but caps is also ok 
2019-01-25 05:13:52	+JohnDoe2	also the {...} notation has a comma instead of a dash
2019-01-25 05:14:02	re101-bongo-826	ah..
2019-01-25 05:14:43	re101-bongo-826	yes, \bm[a-zA-Z]{1,2}[0-9]{1,3} works in regex 101
2019-01-25 05:14:52	re101-bongo-826	... but not in Dbeaver
2019-01-25 05:15:54	+JohnDoe2	have you tried running the command raw, directly using mysql?
2019-01-25 05:16:05	+JohnDoe2	query rather than command 
2019-01-25 05:17:09	re101-bongo-826	i don't really know that that is, running command raw
2019-01-25 05:17:31	+JohnDoe2	what you're using is a javascript UI to a database
2019-01-25 05:17:36	re101-bongo-826	can you do that from the Dbeaver (or other Mysql) client? or does that need to be done from command line?
2019-01-25 05:17:54	+JohnDoe2	most will allow you simply write up your own SELECT 'something' FROM ...
2019-01-25 05:18:17	+JohnDoe2	also, are you sure you're connecting to MySQL/MariaDB?
2019-01-25 05:18:17	re101-bongo-826	OK, i guess this is one of those cases where i thought it was simple... but need to do some more study. Thanks for your kind support!!
2019-01-25 05:18:34	re101-bongo-826	yes, mysql
2019-01-25 05:18:43	re101-bongo-826	(been working with that for 12 years)
2019-01-25 05:19:23	+JohnDoe2	I see 
2019-01-25 05:19:28	re101-bongo-826	but thought i could improve things with RegExp, saw a lot of youtubes and tutorials, now trying in mysql client but not as simple as in python etc.
2019-01-25 05:19:37	+JohnDoe2	well as far as I know MySQL uses POSIX ERE and that regex is valid
2019-01-25 05:20:01	re101-bongo-826	ok, i'll try that link tomorrow. Thank you again, very kind of you to just help noobs like me :-)
2019-01-25 05:20:03	+JohnDoe2	so it might be a matter of looking for the characters that need escaping
2019-01-25 05:20:14	+JohnDoe2	or double escaping :D
2019-01-25 05:20:19	+JohnDoe2	don't worry, I'm a noob too
2019-01-25 05:20:23	+JohnDoe2	good luck!
2019-01-25 05:21:23	re101-bongo-826	The actual regexp i will be using are a lot more complex, was just trying with some simple ones but even those require some getting used to. If it doesn't work with ERE i'll have to access the DB from another angle :-). Thanks again.

2019-01-25 06:08:39	re101-tetra-567	Me too me too, but the regex I'm working on is on a sed
2019-01-25 06:09:01	+Ouims	sed -P supported?
2019-01-25 06:09:07	+OnlineCop	Are you using 'sed -r' which uses more standard regex syntax, or 'sed -e' which requires all the special characters to be escaped?
2019-01-25 06:09:12	+Ouims	for perl support?
2019-01-25 06:09:22	+OnlineCop	No perl support, but '-r' is usually more standard.
2019-01-25 06:09:36	re101-tetra-567	I'm using it without options
2019-01-25 06:09:39	+OnlineCop	'(.+fo{2})'  without having to escape all the parens/brackets.
2019-01-25 06:10:06	re101-tetra-567	Well even on my terminal trying to get everything under process is a mess
2019-01-25 06:10:23	+OnlineCop	In the case of no options, it assumes '-e' so '\(...\)'  is a capture group and '(...)'  is a literal '(' followed by three meta characters followed by a literal ')'
2019-01-25 06:10:35	+Ouims	yeah
2019-01-25 06:10:36	+Ouims	aka
2019-01-25 06:10:59	+Ouims	i'm out of this because it's terrible.
2019-01-25 06:11:15	+OnlineCop	Okay, so in the case of your pasted text, you want to match as long as you have any non-comma values between commas?
2019-01-25 06:11:55	re101-tetra-567	Not exactly, here is the goal of this part of the script :
2019-01-25 06:12:16	re101-tetra-567	I have a line, let's assume "SMITH,WILLIAMS,SIMPSON,SMITH,SMITH,"
2019-01-25 06:12:31	re101-tetra-567	I'm getting the first element under coma, here "SMITH"
2019-01-25 06:12:51	re101-tetra-567	Then I'm trying to delete it, so I have "WILLIAMS,SIMPSON,SMITH,SMITH,"
2019-01-25 06:13:01	re101-tetra-567	Here is the command :
2019-01-25 06:13:07	+OnlineCop	You always want to delete the first one on the line, up to the first comma?
2019-01-25 06:13:13	re101-tetra-567	line=`echo $line | tr ',' '\n' | tail -$((nb_elem-final_count-1)) | tr '\n' ',' | sed "s/,$/\\n/\ g"`
2019-01-25 06:13:18	re101-tetra-567	Yup, always
2019-01-25 06:13:29	re101-tetra-567	But I still want to have, at the end, the element ","
2019-01-25 06:13:37	re101-tetra-567	That should be the last element
2019-01-25 06:13:58	re101-tetra-567	As you can see, I'm using tr to get the first element
2019-01-25 06:14:01	+OnlineCop	Okay, so "SMITH,SMITH," would become  "SMITH,"  but  "SMITH,"  would become ","  ?
2019-01-25 06:14:13	re101-tetra-567	That's it OnlineCop 
2019-01-25 06:14:55	re101-tetra-567	But when I'm transforming the string back with an other tr
2019-01-25 06:14:58	+OnlineCop	One hack would be to replace  /,$/  with something other than a comma. I don't really like that solution.
2019-01-25 06:15:08	re101-tetra-567	Me either :/
2019-01-25 06:15:32	re101-tetra-567	Well, at the end, you got the idea, I end with an unwanted coma
2019-01-25 06:15:43	re101-tetra-567	the last \n, which was here since the beginning
2019-01-25 06:15:45	+OnlineCop	What version of sed do you use? BSD (such as OS X) or GNU (Linux, Windows Mingw)?
2019-01-25 06:15:53	re101-tetra-567	GNU
2019-01-25 06:19:42	re101-tetra-567	Hey I think I did tricked it
2019-01-25 06:20:24	re101-tetra-567	Yay, did, sorry, you couldn't really help me much without the full script
2019-01-25 06:21:00	+OnlineCop	You were able to get it working?
2019-01-25 06:21:02	re101-tetra-567	I just replaced empty lines by comas, since I have a counter, I don't have an infinity loop, and that does the trick
2019-01-25 06:21:19	+OnlineCop	What is all the mess with 'tr' doing there?
2019-01-25 06:21:50	re101-tetra-567	I'm transforming the string with \n so I get the first element using tail
2019-01-25 06:22:08	re101-tetra-567	and then I concat it back
2019-01-25 06:22:28	re101-tetra-567	That's probably not the best way, but I'm a newbie in shell, well I'm training
2019-01-25 06:22:54	+OnlineCop	Are you using sed for portability? What about, say, perl?
2019-01-25 06:22:56	+OnlineCop	$ echo -e 'ABC,DEF,\nDEF,' | perl -pe 's/^[^\n,]+(?:,(?!$))?//g'
2019-01-25 06:22:56	+OnlineCop	DEF,
2019-01-25 06:22:56	+OnlineCop	,
2019-01-25 06:23:03	re101-tetra-567	I can't use perl
2019-01-25 06:23:08	+OnlineCop	Okay, just checking.
2019-01-25 06:23:19	re101-tetra-567	I'm doing this purposely to learn shell
2019-01-25 06:24:05	re101-tetra-567	SO even if that's not really beautiful, I'm understanding better the way of thinking scripts with this kinds of "challenges"
2019-01-25 06:24:40	re101-tetra-567	Well, anyway, thank you guys, talking of an algorithm alway helps understanding it, even if I'm the creator of it ^^
2019-01-25 06:25:32	+OnlineCop	How often do you have leading ',' with text following it?
2019-01-25 06:25:51	re101-tetra-567	It depends of the argument I'm taking
2019-01-25 06:25:59	+OnlineCop	So it _is_possible?
2019-01-25 06:26:01	re101-tetra-567	If the last one is empty, I got a , at the end
2019-01-25 06:26:04	re101-tetra-567	Yes
2019-01-25 06:26:56	+OnlineCop	I guess the best thing I could suggest is to throw up as many different "given this input ___ I expect this output ____" on regex101 so we can be sure that we're handling all the edge cases properly.
2019-01-25 06:28:57	re101-tetra-567	Well, this was really a little part of the script
2019-01-25 06:29:08	re101-tetra-567	This script shall simulate a MySQL
2019-01-25 06:29:22	re101-tetra-567	So the arguments are all on a database
2019-01-25 06:29:51	re101-tetra-567	This part of the script takes a "splitted" version of formatted data"

2019-01-25 06:33:47	re101-tetra-567	I'm formatting the lines myself, and you can't have one line with comas at the end, and the next without
2019-01-25 06:34:03	+OnlineCop	That's fair.

2019-01-25 06:34:08	re101-tetra-567	If there is one time a coma at the end, there is always one on all the lines
2019-01-25 06:34:13	+OnlineCop	I'm just trying to see what a "given ___, I expect ___"
2019-01-25 06:35:01	re101-tetra-567	Yeah, that's the kind of little things that can bug you a whole programm
2019-01-25 06:35:15	re101-tetra-567	But I'm not allowing comas on the datas
2019-01-25 06:35:48	+OnlineCop	I'm mainly trying to cope with edge cases. If you run 'sed' on some text that is malformed (especially since names in a database can contain a ',' character)... then you may have problems.
2019-01-25 06:35:58	re101-tetra-567	That's only a shadow of mysql, and I'm basically creating/decrypting the json myself, and since there is only json, I don't allow any characters that could break a json file
2019-01-25 06:36:55	re101-tetra-567	When I'm under this sed, I already parsed the json so I have only the datas
2019-01-25 06:38:43	re101-tetra-567	Well, working on this script since a long time, 23h30 and I don't have eaten yet, bye, and thank you again !
