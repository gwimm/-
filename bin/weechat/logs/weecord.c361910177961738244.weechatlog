2019-01-30 13:30:01	⚉	And polio
2019-01-30 13:30:09	viz	Didn't know about polio
2019-01-30 13:30:15	viz	Actually
2019-01-30 13:30:20	⚉	Huge outbreak in the US. Didn't sound so fun
2019-01-30 13:30:32	viz	It's only in the US?
2019-01-30 13:30:49	xent	so basically there is air alchohol in vaccines that makes everyone around you drunk and that's how my cousin died from a drunk driver after she got her first vaccines!! 😭😤😤
2019-01-30 13:30:59	⚉	The news story was that a few towns in the US had huge polio outbreaks after too many parents refused to vaccinate their children
2019-01-30 13:31:08	viz	Do you even know how vaccines work
2019-01-30 13:31:10	⚉	This was about a year ago iirc
2019-01-30 13:31:19	viz	Oh no
2019-01-30 13:31:21	viz	That's bad
2019-01-30 13:31:40	xent	yes but the air alchohol is bad for everyone so polio is a sacrifice
2019-01-30 13:31:46	⚉	<:thonk:451159467883626500>
2019-01-30 13:31:55	viz	What
2019-01-30 13:32:01	viz	You're really ignorant
2019-01-30 13:32:18	⚉	Considering what some users here have been honestly saying, I think it's probably in the best interest of everyone here that the circlejerk stop
2019-01-30 13:32:43	viz	I'd be happy if he was circlejerking
2019-01-30 13:32:44	viz	Tbh
2019-01-30 13:33:08	viz	Because that amount of stupidity is ducking terrible
2019-01-30 13:33:22	xent	yes it was bait lol

2019-01-30 13:49:48	gwosix	why is this shit in the client?
2019-01-30 13:49:58	gwosix	!
2019-01-30 13:49:59	[kiwmi] pornguy	you can still send empty messages like this though, since both the client and the server dont check this
2019-01-30 13:50:10	Superuser	haha lol
2019-01-30 13:50:24	davidv7	how do you do that
2019-01-30 13:50:24	gwosix	we need something that's not js garbage
2019-01-30 13:50:29	Superuser	haha
2019-01-30 13:50:31	gwosix	regex david
2019-01-30 13:50:43	gwosix	oh
2019-01-30 13:50:51	gwosix	\
2019-01-30 13:50:53	davidv7	im talking about the empty message
2019-01-30 13:50:54	davidv7	\
2019-01-30 13:51:02	[kiwmi] pornguy	@davidv7#2315 wriet a message
2019-01-30 13:51:02		edit it to an empty string. the server doesnt check edits
2019-01-30 13:51:02		also the client has a bug where sending /nick  actually sends an empty message (and resets your nickname)
2019-01-30 13:51:09	Superuser	this tbh
2019-01-30 13:51:12	davidv7	it does
2019-01-30 13:51:17	davidv7	it deletes the message on an empty string
2019-01-30 13:51:22	davidv7	test
2019-01-30 13:51:32	[kiwmi] pornguy	yes
2019-01-30 13:51:37	[kiwmi] pornguy	thats why you edit it to /nick

2019-01-30 13:51:49	davidv7	ok
2019-01-30 13:51:53	Superuser	also that works&=^
2019-01-30 13:51:57	[kiwmi] pornguy	its either the bug in the client or using the api directly
2019-01-30 13:52:01	[kiwmi] pornguy	@Superuser#1337 thats not empt though
2019-01-30 13:52:05	Superuser	i know

2019-01-30 14:02:50	gwosix	@pornguy don't work though
2019-01-30 14:03:08	gwosix	that would work in the bitlbee client...
2019-01-30 14:03:26	gwosix	alright
2019-01-30 14:03:37	gwosix	never using the official client again, yeet

2019-01-30 14:05:11	gwosix	this is really cozy though
2019-01-30 14:06:24	davidv7	Is there a good client for it even?
2019-01-30 14:06:38	davidv7	When me and viz were trying it out they all sucked
2019-01-30 14:06:42	davidv7	For matrix
2019-01-30 14:07:12	⚉	Fractal is good, gwu likes the weechat plugin
2019-01-30 14:07:28	[kiwmi] pornguy	@OTheB#2311 i do
2019-01-30 14:07:28		but its not smart enough to make shift key was pressed, but not yet released and dollar sign was pressed into dollarsign, but gives me a 4 because retarded
2019-01-30 14:07:41	gwosix	the weechat plugin is really minimal
2019-01-30 14:07:52	gwosix	and it's written in not python
2019-01-30 14:07:56	gwosix	lua uwu
2019-01-30 14:08:00	gwosix	lua is nice
2019-01-30 14:08:07	⚉	If you're just working with small rooms then you really don't need many features
2019-01-30 14:08:13	gwosix	yeah
2019-01-30 14:08:31	gwosix	till now i'm just using matrix to talk to OtheB
2019-01-30 14:08:39	⚉	And starboard
2019-01-30 14:08:49	gwosix	yeah
2019-01-30 14:09:37	gwosix	the client side for weecord isn't that nice
2019-01-30 14:09:45	gwosix	it feels a bit slow and clunky
2019-01-30 14:10:06	gwosix	even with only a few from th 42 servers left
2019-01-30 14:10:17	gwosix	and by a few a mean really just 5 servers
2019-01-30 14:10:30	⚉	hmm
2019-01-30 14:10:35	gwosix	i'm at 101 channels discord autojoins
2019-01-30 14:10:57	gwosix	go.py is a fuzzy finder for channels though so it's cool
2019-01-30 14:11:18	gwosix	and the speed of the client seems to be in no way impeeded upon
2019-01-30 14:11:25	⚉	I have a couple of servers I could cut off
2019-01-30 14:11:37	⚉	That would put me on 3
2019-01-30 14:11:52	yemou	Peen

2019-01-30 14:12:18	⚉	Other one might be a little more tedious
2019-01-30 14:12:20	yemou	That's cool
2019-01-30 14:12:27	gwosix	yeah
2019-01-30 14:12:39	yemou	But can you vc?
2019-01-30 14:12:41	gwosix	weechat is a lot cooler than i thought...

2019-01-30 14:12:49	yemou	Then it's shit
2019-01-30 14:12:58	gwosix	but i can easily open firefox to do so

2019-01-31 00:34:07	natemonster321	and lo, nothing has changed
2019-01-31 00:34:14	natemonster321	tfw still using shitty opengl meme terminal
2019-01-31 00:34:22	natemonster321	rust too
2019-01-31 00:34:44	Renzix	I mean
2019-01-31 00:34:44	Superuser	opengl meme terminal?
2019-01-31 00:34:48	Renzix	if you just want comfy
2019-01-31 00:34:54	Renzix	just use xfce4-terminal
2019-01-31 00:35:00	Renzix	and be lazy
2019-01-31 00:35:12	Superuser	what are the advantages of alacritty?
2019-01-31 00:35:26	Renzix	Alacritty https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty
2019-01-31 00:35:33	Superuser	yea xfce4 apps a pretty good
2019-01-31 00:35:44	Renzix	rust+opengl+yml config file pretty much
2019-01-31 00:36:17	Renzix	o and cross platform
2019-01-31 00:36:42	Renzix	I never tried in in windows tho
2019-01-31 00:36:47	Renzix	and macOS doesnt run it well
2019-01-31 00:36:50	diamondburned	nah hyper's prob better
2019-01-31 00:36:54	diamondburned	on windows
2019-01-31 00:36:57	Superuser	no just no
2019-01-31 00:37:01	diamondburned	no cure for shit font config
2019-01-31 00:37:02	Superuser	fuck hyper
2019-01-31 00:37:23	Superuser	who wants a whole js terminal +electron
2019-01-31 00:37:31	natemonster321	except on windows since it's the only decent one there <:lmaothink:501510595615391745>
2019-01-31 00:38:08	Renzix	what else r u gonna use on windows tho
2019-01-31 00:38:13	Superuser	hyper is on like every package manager lol
2019-01-31 00:38:57	natemonster321	ok time to just use hyper <:lmaothink:501510595615391745>
2019-01-31 00:39:00	Renzix	Im actually curious now to see how alacritty works in windows
2019-01-31 00:39:02	natemonster321	since st is too minimal to be usable
2019-01-31 00:39:08	natemonster321	and alacritty is too meme
2019-01-31 00:39:08	Superuser	https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder <:thinkingsuicide:338804980506951681>
2019-01-31 00:39:13	natemonster321	so just go further in meme <:lmaothink:501510595615391745>
2019-01-31 00:39:15	Renzix	thats allright
2019-01-31 00:39:15	diamondburned	shit font rendering
2019-01-31 00:39:19	Renzix	but still not the best
2019-01-31 00:39:44	Superuser	is kitty a meme too
2019-01-31 00:39:50	natemonster321	yeah
2019-01-31 00:39:51	diamondburned	let's see
2019-01-31 00:39:54	diamondburned	- [x] Python
2019-01-31 00:39:55	diamondburned	yes
2019-01-31 00:39:55	Renzix	kitty is fine
2019-01-31 00:39:56	natemonster321	and the dev is actually an asshole
2019-01-31 00:39:59	Superuser	i know
2019-01-31 00:40:00	Renzix	its c++
2019-01-31 00:40:02	Renzix	wat
2019-01-31 00:40:03	radxix	hello friends
2019-01-31 00:40:03	natemonster321	no
2019-01-31 00:40:05	natemonster321	it's C
2019-01-31 00:40:07	natemonster321	but it still sucks
2019-01-31 00:40:07	Superuser	its python
2019-01-31 00:40:07	natemonster321	iirc
2019-01-31 00:40:10	diamondburned	it's python m9
2019-01-31 00:40:11	natemonster321	python + C
2019-01-31 00:40:16	natemonster321	it's both
2019-01-31 00:40:26	Renzix	o
2019-01-31 00:40:28	natemonster321	C for low-level iirc, and python for high level shit
2019-01-31 00:40:28	Renzix	it is
2019-01-31 00:40:30	natemonster321	or something like that
2019-01-31 00:40:34	Renzix	thats not that bad
2019-01-31 00:40:35	Renzix	tho
2019-01-31 00:40:38	diamondburned	but it has a shit ton of python to qualify it's made with python
2019-01-31 00:40:40	natemonster321	it's still python
2019-01-31 00:40:46	natemonster321	a lot of it
2019-01-31 00:40:46	diamondburned	if I use a cgo binding for opengl, and C is most of my stuff
2019-01-31 00:40:50	diamondburned	you can't call it C
2019-01-31 00:41:13	natemonster321	ngl i think i'll just be omega lazy and use xfce term or smth
2019-01-31 00:41:16	natemonster321	st gae
2019-01-31 00:41:34	radxix	frick you friend
2019-01-31 00:41:35	Renzix	urxvt is also fine
2019-01-31 00:41:40	natemonster321	urxvt gae
2019-01-31 00:41:41	diamondburned	urxvt shit
2019-01-31 00:41:44	Renzix	ree
2019-01-31 00:41:46	natemonster321	i'm never touching that shit
2019-01-31 00:41:56	natemonster321	what's proper font fallbacks? oh yeah that doesn't exist
2019-01-31 00:42:01	natemonster321	neither does true color
2019-01-31 00:42:05	natemonster321	oh and want copy and paste?
2019-01-31 00:42:06	natemonster321	haha
2019-01-31 00:42:09	natemonster321	PERL FAGGOT
2019-01-31 00:42:38	diamondburned	tbh
2019-01-31 00:42:49	diamondburned	i want a dream distro without a c compiler, python, perl or any of that bs
2019-01-31 00:42:51	diamondburned	just binaries
2019-01-31 00:43:00	Renzix	Y no bsd
2019-01-31 00:43:07	natemonster321	>no compiler
2019-01-31 00:43:09	diamondburned	idk tbh lul
2019-01-31 00:43:13	Renzix	bsd has clang
2019-01-31 00:43:16	Renzix	but
2019-01-31 00:43:20	Renzix	thats about it
2019-01-31 00:43:21	Renzix	i think
2019-01-31 00:44:17	arskiy	Have you tried something like LfS?
2019-01-31 00:44:18	diamondburned	wb open
2019-01-31 00:44:24	diamondburned	>lfs
2019-01-31 00:44:24		too lazy
2019-01-31 00:44:27	arskiy	lul
2019-01-31 00:44:32	arskiy	I actually built one
2019-01-31 00:44:36	arskiy	in december
2019-01-31 00:44:51	arskiy	but am too much of a debian pleb to acually use it everyday
2019-01-31 00:45:14	arskiy	one week to compile everything
2019-01-31 00:45:14	Seance	It's <@102934585247039488>! Praise the sun! \[T]/
2019-01-31 00:46:14	arskiy	you actually need gcc, perl and python to get LfS working
2019-01-31 00:46:17	Seance	so y'all, I got a dumb question. Why doesn't neofetch need root to get the output of lspci -mm
2019-01-31 00:46:30	Seance	when the equivalent command outside of neofetch does need it
2019-01-31 00:46:34	diamondburned	you don't need root for lspci -mm
2019-01-31 00:46:36	diamondburned	<:thonk:451159467883626500>
2019-01-31 00:46:49	diamondburned	v
2019-01-31 00:46:51	arskiy	just tested
2019-01-31 00:46:52	diamondburned	https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/361910177961738244/540332103448002562/unknown.png
2019-01-31 00:46:53	arskiy	can confirm
2019-01-31 00:46:58	diamondburned	fuck I just realized st doesn't have tabs
2019-01-31 00:46:59	natemonster321	wtf why does like
2019-01-31 00:47:01	diamondburned	gnome terminal time
2019-01-31 00:47:03	diamondburned	<:GWsoraeDabmoji:407618965112619028>
2019-01-31 00:47:08	natemonster321	no terminal have terminal padding options?
2019-01-31 00:47:08	ym "cp -r" 555	or tabbed
2019-01-31 00:47:09	Seance	Ah, must be a quirk of my distro
2019-01-31 00:47:11	Superuser	lspci needs root in certain distros
2019-01-31 00:47:12	diamondburned	external bin
2019-01-31 00:47:13	diamondburned	bloat
2019-01-31 00:47:13	arskiy	https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/361910177961738244/540332193835253780/unknown.png
2019-01-31 00:47:14	ym "cp -r" 555	tabbed works pretty well
2019-01-31 00:47:17	Renzix	why tf adds padding
2019-01-31 00:47:21	Superuser	kitty has a margon option
2019-01-31 00:47:22	Renzix	on the inside of a terminal
2019-01-31 00:47:27	ym "cp -r" 555	nah it isn't bloat because alot of applications can use it
2019-01-31 00:47:34	diamondburned	i'd prob only use it for st tbh
2019-01-31 00:47:38	ym "cp -r" 555	well a lot
2019-01-31 00:47:46	Renzix	just use tmux
2019-01-31 00:47:47	ym "cp -r" 555	nothing implements the protocol lmao
2019-01-31 00:47:48	Renzix	or somthing
2019-01-31 00:47:49	ym "cp -r" 555	<:GWczeAngryCry:402867151465086981>
2019-01-31 00:47:56	Renzix	good to learn
2019-01-31 00:48:01	arskiy	but still
2019-01-31 00:48:03	Plasma	What’s the point of LFS?
2019-01-31 00:48:07	steamport	hey guys
2019-01-31 00:48:09	Renzix	To make your own distro
2019-01-31 00:48:11	Renzix	wdym
2019-01-31 00:48:12	arskiy	being gay and wasting time
2019-01-31 00:48:13	natemonster321	lfs is gentoo but the next level
2019-01-31 00:48:14	Plasma	But why
2019-01-31 00:48:14	Superuser	i might add like 5 pixels cause i have a large screen, but sometimes the text is a little to close to the borders
2019-01-31 00:48:16	arskiy	as someone who made one
2019-01-31 00:48:18	steamport	i made a script that cowsays a cat fact when i open a terminal
2019-01-31 00:48:21	natemonster321	the gayest level
2019-01-31 00:48:28	Renzix	It exists mainly for knoledge purposes
2019-01-31 00:48:30	steamport	curl -s https://catfact.ninja/fact | jq '.fact' | cowsay -f catfence
2019-01-31 00:48:35	arskiy	literally 15 hours to compile gcc
2019-01-31 00:48:37	Turquoise	i made a script that plays 2048
2019-01-31 00:48:41	arskiy	FUCKING 15 HOURS
2019-01-31 00:48:44	Turquoise	should i commit sudoky

2019-01-31 00:48:51	Seance	I was tooling around looking through how neofetch handles fetching GPU info
2019-01-31 00:48:59	diamondburned	>using jq for a simple json
2019-01-31 00:49:08	Turquoise	> using jq
2019-01-31 00:49:12	Seance	and uses awk to parse    lspci -mm with shell expansion
2019-01-31 00:49:15	arskiy	oh c'mon
2019-01-31 00:49:19	arskiy	jq is nice
2019-01-31 00:49:21	diamondburned	| cut -d\" -f4
2019-01-31 00:49:24	diamondburned	jq is bloat
2019-01-31 00:49:26	Superuser	oof had to compile libc++ just for discord
2019-01-31 00:49:29	steamport	@diamondburned#4507 it's not one entry
2019-01-31 00:49:30	arskiy	very handy when dealing with apis
2019-01-31 00:49:32	Turquoise	jq is bloated and slow
2019-01-31 00:49:35	steamport	@Superuser#1337 laughs in flatpak
2019-01-31 00:49:36	natemonster321	the only long part on libc++ are the tess
2019-01-31 00:49:39	diamondburned	but all you need is fact
2019-01-31 00:49:40	diamondburned	and it works
2019-01-31 00:49:40	natemonster321	you can disable those
2019-01-31 00:49:45	Superuser	flatpaks are bloated
2019-01-31 00:49:45	natemonster321	with a flag iirc
2019-01-31 00:49:49	steamport	@diamondburned#4507 yes but jq lets me just get the fact
2019-01-31 00:49:51	Superuser	and im not on arch anymore
2019-01-31 00:49:52	diamondburned	you don't need length
2019-01-31 00:49:54	diamondburned	so?
2019-01-31 00:49:56	diamondburned	this also does
2019-01-31 00:50:02	diamondburned

2019-01-31 00:50:02		
2019-01-31 00:50:06	diamondburned	you know how json works man
2019-01-31 00:50:18	steamport	oh wow
2019-01-31 00:50:20	steamport	it works?
2019-01-31 00:50:23	steamport	huh
2019-01-31 00:50:24	Turquoise	why not some set magic @diamondburned#4507
2019-01-31 00:50:24	diamondburned	yeah
2019-01-31 00:50:27	steamport	i've never messed with cut
2019-01-31 00:50:29	diamondburned	because im lazy
2019-01-31 00:50:30	Turquoise	you don't even need cut
2019-01-31 00:50:33	diamondburned	i could if it's in a script
2019-01-31 00:50:35	Turquoise	thonking
2019-01-31 00:50:42	Turquoise	works in your cli as well
2019-01-31 00:50:50	diamondburned	yeah but that's h0m0
2019-01-31 00:51:02	Turquoise	doesn't prevent you from being gay
2019-01-31 00:51:04	diamondburned	actually let's try
2019-01-31 00:51:06	diamondburned	not set
2019-01-31 00:51:07	Turquoise	see
2019-01-31 00:51:08	diamondburned	but arrays
2019-01-31 00:51:09	Turquoise	see

2019-01-31 00:52:08	arskiy	cries in fff
2019-01-31 00:52:15	steamport	since apparently IFS isn't meant to be used as a string.split

2019-01-31 00:53:52	diamondburned	you'd have a brain smaller than a micron to use sh tbh
2019-01-31 00:53:59	diamondburned	for anything except running commands in chain

2019-01-31 00:54:11	steamport	why is betterdiscordctl not detecting my flatpak Discord install
2019-01-31 00:54:12	Turquoise	i may have some sh issues
2019-01-31 00:54:16	steamport	even tho i'm using the --flatpak option
2019-01-31 00:54:17	diamondburned	because it's flatpak
2019-01-31 00:54:29	diamondburned	and all the container bs like fp/snap are shit
2019-01-31 00:54:38	steamport	it literally has a --flatpak option
2019-01-31 00:54:43	steamport	and a --snap option
2019-01-31 00:54:44	diamondburned	yeah but it's flatpak
2019-01-31 00:54:46	Renzix	1 why are you using flatpak
2019-01-31 00:54:47	diamondburned	like that'll work
2019-01-31 00:55:04	arskiy	@natemonster321#7520 What are the actual pros from gentoo? aside from the elitism, memes and gay energy
2019-01-31 00:55:13	steamport	@Renzix#7867 you can't compile discord client from source
2019-01-31 00:55:15	Turquoise	it's minimal and flexible
2019-01-31 00:55:16	Renzix	You do everything
2019-01-31 00:55:16	Turquoise	i guess
2019-01-31 00:55:16	diamondburned	light
2019-01-31 00:55:28	diamondburned	you can customize your kernel
2019-01-31 00:55:30	Renzix	Its like if LFS was viable
2019-01-31 00:55:32	Seance	do you need more pros than that
2019-01-31 00:55:32	diamondburned	which tbh is dope as fucking fuck
2019-01-31 00:55:32	natemonster321	gentoo is extremely customizable
2019-01-31 00:55:36	steamport	gentoo is like 1% faster due to GCC optimizations or whatever
2019-01-31 00:55:40	diamondburned	lmao no
2019-01-31 00:55:42	Turquoise	gentoio isn't actually that hard to be honest
2019-01-31 00:55:45	diamondburned	not if you're not an idiot
2019-01-31 00:55:46	natemonster321	use flags are basically analagous to disabling features of programs at compile time
2019-01-31 00:55:50	Turquoise	you just have to bother with the install process
2019-01-31 00:55:52	diamondburned	because I have to customize my kernel on Arch, and it was a fucking pain in t he ass

2019-01-31 00:55:59	steamport	there's the build script

2019-01-31 00:56:07	diamondburned	okay buddy retard
2019-01-31 00:56:14	arskiy	oh ok, seems pretty nice
2019-01-31 00:56:17	natemonster321	the huge thing about gentoo is that it's flexible and can be as minimal or as bloated as you want it to be
2019-01-31 00:56:26	diamondburned	all i care is the kernel tbh
2019-01-31 00:56:30	steamport	i use linux-ck
2019-01-31 00:56:33	diamondburned	my kernel prob has 100 patches on it
2019-01-31 00:56:36	diamondburned	mine has more patches than ck lul
2019-01-31 00:56:38	diamondburned	ck is one of it
2019-01-31 00:56:44	Turquoise	i use some meme kernel
2019-01-31 00:56:45	diamondburned	but i went even further
2019-01-31 00:56:45	natemonster321	+ it's really easy to use custom kernels, customized ebuilds (compile recipes basically) and fun shit like that
2019-01-31 00:56:47	Renzix	I like to give the comparison why do we use binary distros assuming i dont care about speed of compile time
