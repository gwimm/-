2019-01-30 17:22:40	+wraeth	gwosix: I would guess it's your manually fetched sources. You could try bumping the ck-sources ebuild yourself instead.
2019-01-30 17:23:27	+wraeth	cosimone: I don't believe so, but I haven't tried it nor see documentation explicitly forbidding it (but, since it's not mentioned as allowed from what I've seen with a quick glance, I'd guess not).
2019-01-30 17:23:34	gwosix	i'll just find out if my little Makefile hack workss
2019-01-30 17:23:50	gwosix	if i can help the community i will try to, wraeth
2019-01-30 17:24:38	gwosix	OH I THINK IT DID!
2019-01-30 17:24:44	+wraeth	gwosix: If you do successfully bump the ebuild locally, an ebuild patch (and/or full ebuild) would likely be appreciated on bug 675558. :)

2019-01-30 17:27:04	cosimone	wraeth: i see. i set up a script to parse the set file and add every entry in a package.env file automatically, so it's not that big of a deal, but having such a feature directly built into portage would be useful for some cases
2019-01-30 17:27:28	gwosix	con kolivas decides to do this in the Makefile...

2019-01-30 17:27:44	gwosix	and that's what throws the ebuild off...
2019-01-30 17:27:47	gwosix	why though
2019-01-30 17:27:57	gwosix	let me fix the ebuild...

2019-01-30 17:28:51	gwosix	also: why isn't there a ck-sources-9999?
2019-01-30 17:29:10	+wraeth	gwosix: You'd have to ask the maintainer.
2019-01-30 17:29:16	gwosix	hmmm
2019-01-30 17:29:26	+wraeth	May just not have been asked for.
2019-01-30 17:29:36	gwosix	i'm basically on 9999
2019-01-30 17:29:43	gwosix	i just cloned the repo lol xD

2019-01-30 18:01:38	nfk	config should remain only if they are modified, same as other config_protected stuff
2019-01-30 18:02:00	nfk	and since packages can create untracked files at runtime, probably not 100.0%
2019-01-30 18:02:36	nfk	that is, even if you tweaked portage to remove every tracked file when unmerging a package, bits would still likely remain
