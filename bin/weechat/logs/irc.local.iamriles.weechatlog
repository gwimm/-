2019-02-02 13:26:01	gwu	damn
2019-02-05 21:42:09	Iamriles	Bro you wanna make a game in rust?
2019-02-05 21:42:27	gwu	maybe
2019-02-05 21:42:40	Iamriles	I found a pretty cool rust game engine
2019-02-05 21:42:50	gwu	i wanted to make my own linux echosystem in my own language
2019-02-05 21:43:00	gwu	but a game in rust sounds cool too
2019-02-05 21:43:01	gwu	owo
2019-02-05 21:43:18	Iamriles	And I've been learning 3D modeling to
2019-02-05 21:43:27	gwu	i know blender pretty well
2019-02-05 21:43:27	--	[Iamriles] is away: Offline
2019-02-05 21:43:51	gwu	hmmm
2019-02-05 21:43:52	Iamriles	Have you done any 2.8 stuff?
2019-02-05 21:44:10	gwu	i stopped using blender to wait for the update
2019-02-05 21:44:15	gwu	is it out yet?
2019-02-05 21:44:21	Iamriles	Soon
2019-02-05 21:44:25	gwu	yeah
2019-02-05 21:44:27	Iamriles	Betas out
2019-02-05 21:44:32	gwu	uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
2019-02-05 21:44:34	gwu	MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmm
2019-02-05 21:44:43	Iamriles	Official is real soon
2019-02-05 21:44:51	gwu	gimme link to the engine
2019-02-05 21:44:57	Iamriles	Aight
2019-02-05 21:45:23	Iamriles	https://www.amethyst.rs
2019-02-05 21:45:24	Iamriles	title: Amethyst
2019-02-05 21:45:24	Iamriles	description: Official website of the Amethyst game engine.
2019-02-05 21:45:34	Iamriles	It's data driven
2019-02-05 21:45:50	Iamriles	Not object driven
2019-02-05 21:46:10	Iamriles	So it uses an ECS model
2019-02-05 21:46:37	gwu	nice
2019-02-05 21:46:42	Iamriles	Also vulkan backend for the graphics stack
2019-02-05 21:46:57	Iamriles	Shit is rad
2019-02-05 21:47:04	gwu	linux and windows
2019-02-05 21:47:16	gwu	simple design, too
2019-02-05 21:47:16	Iamriles	Yeah
2019-02-05 21:47:27	Iamriles	And Mac p sure
2019-02-05 21:47:38	Iamriles	Anything with rustup
2019-02-05 21:47:44	gwu	yeah, sounds really fucking rad.
2019-02-05 21:48:09	gwu	vulkan's not fully implented though, is it?
2019-02-05 21:48:22	Iamriles	Not really
2019-02-05 21:48:30	Iamriles	Super soon though
2019-02-05 21:48:33	gwu	https://ptpb.pw/INUn.png
2019-02-05 21:48:34	gwu	ah
2019-02-05 21:48:35	gwu	ok
2019-02-05 21:49:13	Iamriles	Their waiting for the new renderer rn now
2019-02-05 21:49:28	Iamriles	EDIT: Theyre waiting for the new renderer rn now
2019-02-05 21:49:31	gwu	oh, you talked to the devs?
2019-02-05 21:49:36	Iamriles	Yeah
2019-02-05 21:49:46	gwu	they cool, too?
2019-02-05 21:49:54	Iamriles	Yeah
2019-02-05 21:50:19	Iamriles	They like have help channels and stuff
2019-02-05 21:51:19	gwu	oh cool, you've already done some stuff with it?
2019-02-05 21:51:44	Iamriles	A bit of the pong tutorial
2019-02-05 21:51:58	gwu	hahaha
2019-02-05 21:52:01	gwu	alright
2019-02-05 21:52:12	gwu	looks really cool
2019-02-05 21:52:18	Iamriles	Is has like a wip textbook as well
2019-02-05 21:52:20	gwu	(looking through the book)
2019-02-05 21:52:21	gwu	yeah
2019-02-05 21:52:52	Iamriles	Specs is the ecs thing they use
2019-02-05 21:53:04	Iamriles	And that has a text as well
2019-02-05 21:54:06	gwu	nothing has to be hardcoded
2019-02-05 21:54:09	gwu	fuck yeah
2019-02-05 21:54:25	Iamriles	I really want a solid portfolio project in the near future I think useing this engine to make a game would be great for that
2019-02-05 21:54:45	gwu	that's true
2019-02-05 21:54:54	gwu	i would be glad to help
2019-02-05 21:55:31	gwu	and i've stopped caring where `*` go for example
2019-02-05 21:55:38	gwu	so i'm at that stage of programming
2019-02-05 21:55:52	gwu	i won't hag on stuff :P
2019-02-05 21:56:14	gwu	do you do test before dev
2019-02-05 21:56:17	gwu	?
2019-02-05 21:56:25	Iamriles	Let me know what your sleep schedule is with timeszone so I can figure out a development schedule
2019-02-05 21:57:20	Iamriles	What do you by test like tdd?
2019-02-05 21:57:39	gwu	UTC+08:00 i'm up from 10am usually till 11pm - 3am
2019-02-05 21:58:09	gwu	schooldays i'm back at 3pm and up till 9 - 11
2019-02-05 21:58:30	gwu	yeah, tdd
2019-02-05 21:59:01	Iamriles	Oh I haven't messed with the tdd stuff in rust yet
2019-02-05 21:59:05	gwu	oh
2019-02-05 21:59:06	gwu	alright
2019-02-05 21:59:10	gwu	it's really easy
2019-02-05 21:59:29	gwu	`#[test]` and then write your test func
2019-02-05 21:59:35	Iamriles	Theres a section in the book on p sure
2019-02-05 21:59:41	gwu	https://www.amethyst.rs/book/latest/testing.html
2019-02-05 22:00:17	gwu	my branch won't be tdd but i'll make it look like it when i push :P
2019-02-05 22:01:40	Iamriles	Okay. Do you just use the standard rust style guide
2019-02-05 22:01:53	gwu	fmt
2019-02-05 22:02:03	gwu	i've stopped caring about it myself
2019-02-05 22:02:12	gwu	i let programms decide
2019-02-05 22:02:43	Iamriles	Okay emacs uses that as my formating backend for rust.
2019-02-05 22:02:55	gwu	:ok_hand:
2019-02-05 22:03:35	Iamriles	God praise rust tooling 🙏 🙏
2019-02-05 22:03:46	gwu	though, first i think we should have an idea for a game. if we want to make one.
2019-02-05 22:03:56	gwu	you want to do 3d?
2019-02-05 22:04:28	Iamriles	Let's do some shitty 2d games first
2019-02-05 22:04:52	Iamriles	Get used to git and shit.
2019-02-05 22:05:09	gwu	something like hollowknight?
2019-02-05 22:05:26	Iamriles	Yeah that would be cool
2019-02-05 22:06:00	Iamriles	Oh shit we could generate 2d Sprite sheets with blender
2019-02-05 22:06:03	gwu	that won't be too dificult
2019-02-05 22:06:07	gwu	yeah, we can
2019-02-05 22:06:50	Iamriles	Pretty sure the engine has good animation support.
2019-02-05 22:07:23	Iamriles	I'm taking a kinomatics course right now.
2019-02-05 22:07:57	Iamriles	Could possibly do cool physics shit at some point
2019-02-05 22:08:08	gwu	it doesn't do that for us yet?
2019-02-05 22:08:24	gwu	it does collision though, right?
2019-02-05 22:08:25	Iamriles	Don't thinks so
2019-02-05 22:08:47	Iamriles	It probably has collision
2019-02-05 22:09:03	gwu	it better >:(
2019-02-05 22:09:04	gwu	xD
2019-02-05 22:09:09	Iamriles	And solid body aswell?
2019-02-05 22:09:21	gwu	we'll communicate over discord
2019-02-05 22:09:22	gwu	right?
2019-02-05 22:10:15	Iamriles	Yeah we could create separate server with a git bot to game repos.
2019-02-05 22:11:05	Iamriles	Aight I'm going to sleep for now I'll probably message you tomorrow.
2019-02-05 22:11:11	gwu	yeah, me too
2019-02-05 22:11:19	gwu	naice though
2019-02-05 22:11:25	gwu	this'll be lotsa fun
