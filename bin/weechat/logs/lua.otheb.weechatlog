2019-01-30 20:58:13	< gwu>	i don't know how the weechat plugin works
2019-01-30 20:58:18	< gwu>	i'll read the source later

2019-01-31 10:30:59	< gwu>	i'm in love with irc 'n stuff...
2019-01-31 10:34:07	<~OTheB>	Definitely seems like it
2019-01-31 10:36:05	<~OTheB>	Fractal's being ported for the Librem 5 which is cool, so now there'll be the stock messages app for smaller group conversations that's laid out more like texts, then I'll be able to hop straight over to Fractal for larger groups. The more stuff they show you, the better it all looks
2019-01-31 12:32:30	< gwu>	huh
2019-01-31 12:32:33	< gwu>	uwu
2019-02-01 04:18:31	< gwu>	bitblbee is so great

2019-02-01 10:34:21	< gwu>	facebook messenger
2019-02-01 10:43:49	<~OTheB>	Are you just going to connect every IM service ever to this?
2019-02-01 10:44:27	< gwu>	the only real whatsapp one is really old...
2019-02-01 10:44:39	< gwu>	and that's the only other thing i use...

2019-02-02 14:17:37	< gwu>	this exists...
2019-02-02 14:18:31	< gwu>	it requires a...
2019-02-02 14:18:35	< gwu>	well, this
2019-02-02 14:18:36	< gwu>	https://ptpb.pw/TEcD
2019-02-03 01:58:17	<~OTheB>	inb4 IRC becomes the new emacs
2019-02-03 11:19:07	< gwu>	OH YEAH
2019-02-04 20:55:10	<~OTheB>	btw ptpb images don't open properly. You get gibberish text in ff rather than the image.
2019-02-06 08:40:05	< gwu>	oh what
2019-02-06 08:40:14	< gwu>	https://ptpb.pw/vhbY.png
2019-02-06 08:40:19	< gwu>	that doesn't work?
2019-02-06 17:18:22	<~OTheB>	wat. Now it does... HMMMMMMM
2019-02-06 17:18:22		Oh, no, the previous one (TEcD) fucks up, but this one is fine.
2019-02-06 17:19:17	<~OTheB>	No preview on either though which is a shame. Does weechat not let you post them directly? Would kinda make sense considering it can't display them, but would still be nice to send them directly.
2019-02-06 18:50:59	< gwu>	hmmm
2019-02-06 18:51:41	< gwu>	https://ptpb.pw/Vkwj.png
2019-02-06 18:51:45	< gwu>	that's weird
2019-02-06 18:51:48	< gwu>	it should work though
2019-02-06 18:58:22	<~OTheB>	AH ok I know what it is. You need to add the png extension.
2019-02-06 18:58:45	<~OTheB>	So the one earlier that didn't work didin't have the extension
