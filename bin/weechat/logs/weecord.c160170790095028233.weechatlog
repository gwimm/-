2017-10-20 04:00:06	Skippy	The below Code of Conduct is based on the "Go Community Code of Conduct " with only slight modifications as are needed to apply the rules to this space.  It is our intent that this space be treated like any other Go Community space. (<https://golang.org/conduct>).
2017-10-20 04:00:17	Skippy	This community is not a free speech venue; it is for discussion about, or related to, the Go programming language. The below CoC (code of conduct) is to be followed by all members of this community and violations of this CoC may result in a permenant ban.

2017-10-20 04:00:27		About
2017-10-20 04:00:27		Online communities include people from many different backgrounds. The Moderators and Admins here are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of age, disability, gender, nationality, ethnicity, religion, sexuality, or similar personal characteristic.
2017-10-20 04:00:27		The first goal of the Code of Conduct is to specify a baseline standard of behavior so that people with different social values and communication styles can talk about Go effectively, productively, and respectfully.
2017-10-20 04:00:27		The second goal is to provide a mechanism for resolving conflicts in the community when they arise.
2017-10-20 04:00:27		The third goal of the Code of Conduct is to make our community welcoming to people from different backgrounds. Diversity is critical to the project; for Go to be successful, it needs contributors and users from all backgrounds. (See Go, Open Source, Community. <https://blog.golang.org/open-source>)
2017-10-20 04:00:27		With that said, a healthy community must allow for disagreement and debate. The Code of Conduct is not a mechanism for people to silence others with whom they disagree

2017-10-20 04:00:45		Gopher values
2017-10-20 04:00:45		 These are the values to which people in the Go community (“Gophers”) should aspire.
2017-10-20 04:00:45		  Be friendly and welcoming
2017-10-20 04:00:45		  Be patient
2017-10-20 04:00:45		        Remember that people have varying communication styles and that not everyone is using their native language. (Meaning and tone can be lost in translation.) 
2017-10-20 04:00:45		  Be thoughtful
2017-10-20 04:00:45		        Productive communication requires effort. Think about how your words will be interpreted.
2017-10-20 04:00:45		        Remember that sometimes it is best to refrain entirely from commenting. 
2017-10-20 04:00:45		  Be respectful
2017-10-20 04:00:45		        In particular, respect differences of opinion. 
2017-10-20 04:00:45		  Be charitable
2017-10-20 04:00:45		        Interpret the arguments of others in good faith, do not seek to disagree.
2017-10-20 04:00:45		        When we do disagree, try to understand why. 
2017-10-20 04:00:45		  Avoid destructive behavior:
2017-10-20 04:00:45		        Derailing: stay on topic; if you want to talk about something else, start a new conversation.
2017-10-20 04:00:45		        Unconstructive criticism: don't merely decry the current state of affairs; offer—or at least solicit—suggestions as to how things may be improved.
2017-10-20 04:00:45		        Snarking (pithy, unproductive, sniping comments)
2017-10-20 04:00:45		        Discussing potentially offensive or sensitive issues; this all too often leads to unnecessary conflict.
2017-10-20 04:00:45		        Microaggressions: brief and commonplace verbal, behavioral and environmental indignities that communicate hostile, derogatory or negative slights and insults to a person or group. 
2017-10-20 04:00:45		People are complicated. You should expect to be misunderstood and to misunderstand others; when this inevitably occurs, resist the urge to be defensive or assign blame. Try not to take offense where no offense was intended. Give people the benefit of the doubt. Even if the intent was to provoke, do not rise to it. It is the responsibility of all parties to de-escalate conflict when it arises.

2018-07-25 15:50:09		Conflict Resolution
2018-07-25 15:50:09		We do not believe that all conflict is bad; healthy debate and disagreement often yield positive results. However, it is never okay to be disrespectful or to engage in behavior that violates the code of conduct.
2018-07-25 15:50:09		If you see someone violating the code of conduct, you are encouraged to address the behavior directly with those involved. Many issues can be resolved quickly and easily, and this gives people more control over the outcome of their dispute. If you are unable to resolve the matter for any reason, or if the behavior is threatening or harassing, report it. The @Mod Team  is dedicated to providing an environment where participants feel welcome and safe.
2018-07-25 15:50:09		Reports should be directed to the @Mod Team . It is the the @Mod Team's duty to receive and address reported violations of the code of conduct. If for any reason you are uncomfortable reaching out the @Mod Team, please contact one of the Discord Gopher admins, @iopred#0032 and @Skippy#0102 .
2018-07-25 15:50:09		We will investigate every complaint, but you may not receive a direct response. We will use our discretion in determining when and how to follow up on reported incidents, which may range from not taking action to permanent ban from the Discord Gophers server. We will notify the accused of the report and provide them an opportunity to discuss it before any action is taken. The identity of the reporter will be omitted from the details of the report supplied to the accused. In potentially harmful situations, such as ongoing harassment or threats to anyone’s safety, we may take action without notice.
