2019-01-25 09:16:22	june	It's generally a subset of printable ASCII
2019-01-25 09:16:33	june	But it's really on a server-by-server basis
2019-01-25 09:17:28	june	okay only FreeBSD has iswascii I should really not use that

2019-01-25 09:22:33	sarnold	normally they're hideous messes of twenty years of hacks to make things work on both red hat linux 6.2 and that one guy's slackware system stillrunning linux 1.2.13..
2019-01-25 09:22:53	gwu	sarnold _ok_hand_ the linux one...
2019-01-25 09:23:21	sarnold	gwu: have you moved to ELF from a.out yet? :)
2019-01-25 09:23:28	june	Well I write only the subset of make that is portable between BSD make and GNU make which is really tiny
2019-01-25 09:23:38	june	So at least that'll always work on GNU systems
2019-01-25 09:23:48	june	(because I develop on macOS which ships GNU make)
2019-01-25 09:24:34	jebrosen	That's a bit surprising considering it's mostly BSDlike
2019-01-25 09:24:48	gwu	june: is wildcard not a thing in bsdmake?
2019-01-25 09:25:11	june	If you mean % substitution rules, no

2019-01-25 09:26:01	june	oh yeah nothing like that syntax exists in BSD
2019-01-25 09:26:20	june	jebrosen: yeah macOS is a weird hybrid of mostly FreeBSD and a little bit of GNU
2019-01-25 09:26:23	sarnold	jebrosen: what's it do on osx?
2019-01-25 09:26:33	june	And some of their own weird toolchain

2019-01-25 11:31:45	projektir	I did my chores and it is still only 7:30 PM.
2019-01-25 11:31:50	dgriffen	Lol
2019-01-25 11:31:52	projektir	Astraea: look at me I did chores.
2019-01-25 11:32:07	sarnold	partytime!
2019-01-25 11:32:21	dgriffen	Undo all that hard work with a big party!
2019-01-25 11:32:29	Astraea	projektir: look at me, I didn't shovel the driveway because it's cold outside! lol
2019-01-25 11:32:34	projektir	lol
2019-01-25 11:32:35	Astraea	how do you think your interview went?
2019-01-25 11:32:41	projektir	Astraea: I... am not sure...
2019-01-25 11:32:51	projektir	I have another one today. Perhaps it will be clearer.
2019-01-25 11:33:12	Astraea	it's a job somewhere in Europe?
2019-01-25 11:33:37	projektir	Yes.
2019-01-25 11:34:00	Astraea	you're more adventurous than I am!
2019-01-25 11:34:13	Astraea	that kind of move would paralyze me with anxiety
2019-01-25 11:35:59	projektir	Don't worry, I get paralyzed with anxiety by take home assignments, apparently.
2019-01-25 11:36:36	dgriffen	You passed though :D
2019-01-25 11:36:52	projektir	Somehow.
2019-01-25 11:36:56	projektir	By some stroke of luck.
2019-01-25 11:37:06	dgriffen	Or skill

2019-01-25 11:38:15	june	fwiw: you can tell it's fake because someone wrote Python 3
2019-01-25 11:39:09	projektir	Astraea: that assignment did not make me feel at all skilled.
2019-01-25 11:39:15	projektir	If anything it made me feel incompetent as fuck.
2019-01-25 11:39:35	Astraea	what was it?
2019-01-25 11:39:46	dgriffen	If they were impressed with it though it must mean you did well.
2019-01-25 11:40:31	dgriffen	And I don't think doing well happens by accident.
2019-01-25 11:40:59	projektir	Astraea: it's not that it was super hard per se.
2019-01-25 11:41:14	Astraea	well I can almost guarantee you did better than I would have in either case
2019-01-25 11:41:23	projektir	It's more like I wasn't clear what the expectations were, at all, and I was told it's a trivially easy assignment anyone can pass who can "use a computer".
2019-01-25 11:41:32	projektir	Which fucked with my head fucking majorly.
2019-01-25 11:41:57	projektir	Meanwhile, I'm like.
2019-01-25 11:42:09	projektir	"You realize there are devs out there who don't know how to use git?"
2019-01-25 11:42:26	dgriffen	Is that some fancy form of source Depot?
2019-01-25 11:43:35	Astraea	I know loads of people who can use a computer but not git
2019-01-25 11:43:44	projektir	My point exactly.
2019-01-25 11:43:48	Astraea	git isn't exactly user friendly after you get past the very basics
2019-01-25 11:44:02	projektir	So as you can imagine, working on something when you know the other side has a pretty warped idea of "easy" is pretty stressful.
2019-01-25 11:44:06	projektir	At least, it is for someone like me.
2019-01-25 11:44:46	june	ugh okay how do I create an array for signals on GNU
2019-01-25 11:44:56	june	It won't tell me how many signals there are
2019-01-25 11:48:23	Moongoodboy{K}	projektir: sounds like a big red flag.
2019-01-25 11:48:32	Moongoodboy{K}	remember, you're evaluating them too
2019-01-25 11:48:49	june	projektir will get mad at you for saying red flag
2019-01-25 11:48:52	projektir	A bit...
2019-01-25 11:48:58	Moongoodboy{K}	if they're stressing you out and being condescending and dismissive NOW…
2019-01-25 11:49:10	june	sarnold: how do people program for GNU
2019-01-25 11:49:22	sarnold	june: with careful reference to the docs. often.
2019-01-25 11:49:22	projektir	Moongoodboy{K}: to be fair, these particular statements did not come from the company directly.
2019-01-25 11:49:34	projektir	In this particular case, though, it's something else I'm evaluating.
2019-01-25 11:49:35	june	sarnold: GNU docs are awful and they won't tell me how many signals there are
2019-01-25 11:49:36	sarnold	june: lol I'm just kidding
2019-01-25 11:49:44	sarnold	june: they copy-paste from stackoverflow of course
2019-01-25 11:49:47	projektir	But I'm also not sure if it's not just me being oversensitive.
2019-01-25 11:49:58	june	sarnold: explains the prevalent quality of software for GNU
2019-01-25 11:50:03	sarnold	june: the number of signals depends upon the os kernel you're running..
2019-01-25 11:50:21	Moongoodboy{K}	In C? Isn't that defined in a header?
2019-01-25 11:50:37	june	Moongoodboy{K}: NSIG is defined in signal.h on BSD...
2019-01-25 11:52:37	Moongoodboy{K}	Yeah, like that.
2019-01-25 11:53:58	june	ugh okay defining _GNU_SOURCE makes it appear
2019-01-25 11:54:43	june	lol strcasestr does exist but strnstr doesn't
2019-01-25 11:54:47	june	GNU is a fuck
2019-01-25 11:55:29	Moongoodboy{K}	>C string functions

2019-01-25 11:57:09	Moongoodboy{K}	C string functions are terrible on everything
2019-01-25 11:57:38	Moongoodboy{K}	C overall is an old, hot mess
2019-01-25 11:58:00	WindowsBunny	just avoid C
2019-01-25 11:58:24	june	C is not a mess
2019-01-25 11:58:25	sarnold	how to write secure C, as evidenced by DJB: step one, ignore the standard string functions and write your own. step two, don't make mistakes.
2019-01-25 11:58:27	june	C is not old
2019-01-25 11:58:30	Moongoodboy{K}	it was amazing for its time, but it's time to deprecate it
2019-01-25 11:58:43	june	C11 is only 8 years old!
2019-01-25 11:58:55	Moongoodboy{K}	C11 is backwards compatible with C89…
2019-01-25 11:58:58	june	sounds like Moongoodboy{K} doesn't know how to write C :P
2019-01-25 11:59:57	Moongoodboy{K}	#include, null-terminated strings, UB pitfalls everywhere, barely-useful standard library, insane integer types…
2019-01-25 12:00:02	Moongoodboy{K}	Ugeh.
2019-01-25 12:00:15	june	you just don't know the way

2019-01-25 12:00:46	Moongoodboy{K}	no thanks
2019-01-25 12:01:03	Moongoodboy{K}	I'm good with my Rust

2019-01-25 12:03:12	june	C is the best language I've ever used
2019-01-25 12:03:49	june	I'm okay with you interpreting that as an indictment of other languages rather than a commendation of C
2019-01-25 12:03:57	sarnold	lol
2019-01-25 12:04:21	projektir	C is very difficult to use.
2019-01-25 12:04:25	sarnold	I learned something shocking about perl today https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2019/01/msg00299.html

2019-01-25 12:04:44	projektir	It might be good if you are very smart, have great attention to detail, and C is all you use.
2019-01-25 12:04:44	dgriffen	nah, punchcards are where its at
2019-01-25 12:04:50	Moongoodboy{K}	june: Don't conflate simplicity with ease of use.
2019-01-25 12:04:57	Moongoodboy{K}	C is very simple, and very difficult.
2019-01-25 12:05:01	june	nah
2019-01-25 12:05:05	projektir	I will not insult you by assuming you don't realize C is not considered easy for good reasons.
2019-01-25 12:05:29	june	also attention to detail is a vital aspect of programming in any language
2019-01-25 12:05:38	Moongoodboy{K}	also I'm going to stop now because I think it's fairly clear at this point that june isn't being sincere :p
2019-01-25 12:05:50	projektir	C takes it to a level above mine.
2019-01-25 12:06:01	projektir	And I've been told I have quite good attention to detail, lol
2019-01-25 12:06:05	june	Moongoodboy{K}: I'm sincere about my own feelings towards C
2019-01-25 12:06:15	Moongoodboy{K}	june: In the words of the eev.ee. author, “My tools should not create net positive work for me.”
2019-01-25 12:06:39	june	Moongoodboy{K}: It *is* the best language I've ever used and it *is* the language I am most productive in
2019-01-25 12:06:51	Moongoodboy{K}	C plops you right down into the cave with the dragon, and makes you tiptoe around it.
2019-01-25 12:07:02	Moongoodboy{K}	And also the floor is full of holes.
2019-01-25 12:07:06	projektir	june: you might be uniquely talented for it. Most of us aren't.
2019-01-25 12:07:09	Moongoodboy{K}	And it's dark, so you can't see them very well.
2019-01-25 12:07:14	june	"My tools should not create positive work me" is definitely something I agree with
2019-01-25 12:07:24	june	It's why I don't use Rust much anymore :P
2019-01-25 12:07:25	gwu	Moongoodboy{K} i'm on gentoo.
2019-01-25 12:07:28	dgriffen	oh ffs MS... STOP REPLYING TO THE DAMN EMAIL
2019-01-25 12:07:29	projektir	If you give me C my speed of development will drop to a snail pace.
2019-01-25 12:07:35	Moongoodboy{K}	june: The implication is that tiptoeing around UB is work.
2019-01-25 12:07:46	projektir	Or, I'll rush and cause use after deallocs everywhere.
2019-01-25 12:07:53	june	You don't need to tiptoe around UB
2019-01-25 12:07:55	Moongoodboy{K}	C is fearsome.
2019-01-25 12:08:06	projektir	Source: used C in college. Ugh.
2019-01-25 12:08:11	projektir	Segfault this, segfault that.
2019-01-25 12:08:15	sarnold	god when I think of the C I wrote back then ..
2019-01-25 12:08:15	gwu	C's lifspan is over
2019-01-25 12:08:16	june	Aside from the common stuff like signed overflow, UB is not hard to avoid
2019-01-25 12:08:24	projektir	june: perhaps not for you.
2019-01-25 12:08:27	gwu	but C isn't as cancer as all the noobs make it out to be
2019-01-25 12:08:41	Moongoodboy{K}	quick, someone make a glitch hop track and call it /Segfault/
2019-01-25 12:08:41	projektir	But just look at how many bugs there are in your average C program.
2019-01-25 12:08:43	gwu	projektir, just write good code
2019-01-25 12:08:47	june	people act like everything in C is UB when actually the things that are UB are quite reasonable
2019-01-25 12:08:58	projektir	gwu: are you being facetious?
2019-01-25 12:09:02	gwu	Moongoodboy{K} camellia did it.
2019-01-25 12:09:05	Moongoodboy{K}	>UB is not hard to avoid
2019-01-25 12:09:13	Moongoodboy{K}	sure, just don't use pointers at all and you're golden.
2019-01-25 12:09:16	gwu	projektir, partially, mostly not.
2019-01-25 12:09:22	Moongoodboy{K}	oh, except for the uninit thing.
2019-01-25 12:09:27	projektir	I recall Manishearth just mentioning a couple instances of C's UB and it didn't seem intuitive at all.
2019-01-25 12:09:35	projektir	gwu: pray tell hwo does one just write good code?
2019-01-25 12:09:40	sarnold	I dunno about *reasonable* -- just a few hours ago I explained to a coworker why 1 << 31 didn't work correctly on two of our N supported platforms -- and he's been doing this work for a few decades too :) C absolutely should have specified signed overflow behaviour
2019-01-25 12:10:04	projektir	gwu: is there anything to this besides you saying "I am a good developers and you are not, because I'm comfortable with C and you are not?"
2019-01-25 12:10:26	gwu	don't forget about what happens under the hood. c is the mobile assembler, not a total abstraction projektir
2019-01-25 12:10:30	june	idk these examples seem reasonable to me https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_behavior#Examples_in_C_and_C++
2019-01-25 12:10:32	--	Notice(u): ⤷ Undefined behavior - Wikipedia
2019-01-25 12:10:42	projektir	gwu: C is very far from assembler these days.
2019-01-25 12:10:52	gwu	it isn't
2019-01-25 12:10:57	projektir	The compiler performs lots of optimizations that make assuming things about the assembler not a great idea anymore.
2019-01-25 12:11:04	Moongoodboy{K}	>C is the mobile assembler.
2019-01-25 12:11:11	Moongoodboy{K}	Very good argument against using it directly.
2019-01-25 12:11:41	Moongoodboy{K}	see also: the thing where, except in specialized cases (e.g. optimizing VERY hot paths), nobody writes assembler anymore.
2019-01-25 12:11:57	june	C is a perfect level of abstraction imo
2019-01-25 12:11:58	sarnold	indeed I think we've come to the conclusion that C's no longer safe for cryptography work because algorithms that might have been written constant-time in the *source* can be compiled to non-constant-time machine code.
2019-01-25 12:12:05	Moongoodboy{K}	Write code in a GOOD language and make the computer compile it for you.
2019-01-25 12:12:15	Moongoodboy{K}	i.e.…what computers are MEANT for.
2019-01-25 12:12:16	june	Well actually I think you could add a *tiny* amount more abstraction to C
2019-01-25 12:12:21	june	very tiny
2019-01-25 12:12:53	projektir	C will become relevant when you can magically start producing zounds of perfect developers. :)
2019-01-25 12:12:53	Moongoodboy{K}	Writing C is no longer a worthwhile sapient endeavor.
2019-01-25 12:12:58	june	I think rather than "write good code" I'd say "write dumb code"
2019-01-25 12:13:09	projektir	For the fallible mortals among us, C is basically useless.
2019-01-25 12:13:26	june	this is some learned helplessness shit but ok
2019-01-25 12:13:33	Moongoodboy{K}	We have better languages, and automated tools that compile them on par with C.
2019-01-25 12:13:34	gwu	projektir, how much C have you written?
2019-01-25 12:13:48	projektir	Not that much. And the little that I did was full of segfaults.
2019-01-25 12:13:49	june	If you learn Rust, C becomes much easier to write ime
2019-01-25 12:14:09	projektir	I remember seeing a _small_ sliver of the list of all forms of UB in C.
2019-01-25 12:14:17	projektir	Thanks but no thanks, that was fucking insane.
2019-01-25 12:14:22	projektir	C is just walking esoterica.
2019-01-25 12:14:23	june	Because you can apply concepts from Rust to any language and it will help your code, I think
2019-01-25 12:14:40	gwu	projektir, don't dare accuse c of being at fault if you can't write it.
2019-01-25 12:14:41	projektir	Or I can just use Rust, which was made precisely for dumb fucks like me.
2019-01-25 12:14:47	Moongoodboy{K}	june: There is no reason that YOU should have to prove lifetimes.
2019-01-25 12:14:54	projektir	gwu: there seem to be lots of people who can't write it.
2019-01-25 12:14:58	sarnold	projektir: heh, and here I'm afraid I'm not smart enough to do rust :)
2019-01-25 12:14:58	Moongoodboy{K}	june: The COMPUTER should prove that your lifetimes are sound FOR you.
2019-01-25 12:15:05	june	Moongoodboy{K}: okay but rust don't do that
2019-01-25 12:15:10	Moongoodboy{K}	And warn you if they're not.
2019-01-25 12:15:13	projektir	gwu: otherwise explain why Pidgin is full of CVEs? Why does heartbleed exist? All these smart people writing C.
2019-01-25 12:15:15	projektir	Still make mistakes.
2019-01-25 12:15:25	Moongoodboy{K}	june: Rust does EXACTLY that. That is like HALF THE POINT of Rust.
2019-01-25 12:15:27	dgriffen	I would argue that no one can write a non-trivial C program
2019-01-25 12:15:33	june	Moongoodboy{K}: you have to do extra work to convince Rust your shit is safe
2019-01-25 12:15:43	june	that shit is esoteric
2019-01-25 12:15:51	Moongoodboy{K}	june: But once it compiles, you can be certain that it IS sound.
2019-01-25 12:15:55	projektir	Rust tells you about it, though.
2019-01-25 12:15:58	Moongoodboy{K}	^
2019-01-25 12:15:59	projektir	C doesn't.
2019-01-25 12:16:10	gwu	projektir, languages are strange, if you actually know how to write them it feels like a whole new world has been opened up to you.
2019-01-25 12:16:11	projektir	Rust esoteric shit can be safely learned over time.
2019-01-25 12:16:23	Moongoodboy{K}	Rust has a steep learning curve, but once you master it you can be fast and fearless.
2019-01-25 12:16:36	projektir	gwu: this seems like a very self-centered perspective.
2019-01-25 12:16:47	projektir	I don't care about opening new worlds, I care about writing quality software.
2019-01-25 12:16:49	june	Or you can learn Rust then go back to C and write safe code without all the downsides
2019-01-25 12:16:50	Moongoodboy{K}	C…you will never reach the point where you write 100% sound code 100% of the time.
2019-01-25 12:16:59	Moongoodboy{K}	Ever.
2019-01-25 12:16:59	gwu	projektir, i would agree that it is time to move on from languages like C, but to slander the name like this is just disrespectful.
2019-01-25 12:17:00	WindowsBunny	I spent a lot of time with C and C++ and I can very confidentally write C and C++ that is usually okay
2019-01-25 12:17:02	projektir	june: except I'd have to go learn all of C's UB.
2019-01-25 12:17:09	projektir	Please explain to me what the point of this is.
2019-01-25 12:17:15	Moongoodboy{K}	If you do, then you're not an organic and I am VERY interested as to your planet of origin
2019-01-25 12:17:17	WindowsBunny	I know more about C UB than most good C programmers
2019-01-25 12:17:19	projektir	gwu: it's a language not a person lel
2019-01-25 12:17:22	WindowsBunny	and yet I'd still rather write Rust
2019-01-25 12:17:22	gwu	they had their place and they did what they were designed to to do.
2019-01-25 12:18:01	Moongoodboy{K}	gwu: This isn't slander; this is honest discussion and criticism of its shortcomings.
2019-01-25 12:18:07	june	Rust propaganda appears effective tbh
2019-01-25 12:18:18	projektir	I have no objection to C at the time of its creation, but these days it just seems to be used for masturbation purposes by programmers with something to prove.
2019-01-25 12:18:31	Moongoodboy{K}	As I've said, it absolutely was an amazing language in its time.
2019-01-25 12:18:41	Moongoodboy{K}	Today is merely no longer it's time.
2019-01-25 12:18:58	projektir	The ENTIRE defense of C rests on "if you can't use it, you just suck and you should stop writing software".
2019-01-25 12:19:02	projektir	There's literally nothing else.
2019-01-25 12:19:06	Astraea	pfft, lisp already existed
2019-01-25 12:19:09	Astraea	there was no need for C
2019-01-25 12:19:09	Astraea	=P
2019-01-25 12:20:55	june	I think there are much better defences of C
2019-01-25 12:21:01	Moongoodboy{K}	Again, in the words of eev.ee.
2019-01-25 12:21:27	Moongoodboy{K}	>Do not tell me that “good developers can write good code in any language”, or bad developers blah blah. That doesn’t /mean/ anything. A good carpenter /can/ drive in a nail with either a rock or a hammer, but how many carpenters do you see bashing stuff with rocks? Part of what makes a good developer is the ability to /choose/ the tools that work best.
2019-01-25 12:22:07	projektir	I would honestly stop at "I can't use this language".
2019-01-25 12:22:11	Moongoodboy{K}	C was one of the best languages of its time (okay really just repeating myself now). We have better.
2019-01-25 12:22:19	projektir	I think that's a fair thing to say and developers shouldn't be afraid of saying it.
2019-01-25 12:22:33	projektir	This whole running around avoiding admitting that you're not good at something is a fucking farce.
2019-01-25 12:22:50	projektir	So everyone just follows the arrogant asshole who claims he's great.
2019-01-25 12:22:56	june	But you can't say anything good about C these days without people parroting "C is bad because of 'UB'"
2019-01-25 12:23:14	Moongoodboy{K}	C isn't good.
2019-01-25 12:23:22	june	C is good in plenty of ways
2019-01-25 12:23:25	projektir	Yes, because using C currently just seems strange.
2019-01-25 12:23:25	Moongoodboy{K}	It's good by 1980s standards. It's not good anymore.
2019-01-25 12:23:34	june	UB isn't one of those ways
2019-01-25 12:23:42	Moongoodboy{K}	There's not much good to say about using C today.
2019-01-25 12:23:46	june	But ignoring the rest of the language is just ignorant imo
2019-01-25 12:23:52	projektir	Worst yet, there isn't even a good collection of all of C's UB, as far as I'm aware.
2019-01-25 12:23:54	Moongoodboy{K}	All of the good things about C that I can think of are historical.
2019-01-25 12:24:02	projektir	C is very simple, it's not like there's much to ignore.
2019-01-25 12:24:04	Moongoodboy{K}	e.g. it paved the way for modern computing
2019-01-25 12:24:16	Moongoodboy{K}	e.g. it's the foundation on which we still build
2019-01-25 12:24:17	june	projektir: Its simplicity is a Good Thing
2019-01-25 12:24:23	Moongoodboy{K}	june: Disagree.

2019-01-25 12:24:33	Moongoodboy{K}	Its simplicity places undue burden on the programmer.
2019-01-25 12:24:38	projektir	I'm neutral on that aspect. Simplicity or complexity is IMO fairly orthogonal at times.

2019-01-25 12:25:02	Moongoodboy{K}	Simplicity may have been good in the past: it was easy to write and propagate compilers for C.

2019-01-25 12:25:47	projektir	If you want to justify C you need to make a case for why it is still the superior language to solve a certain problem.
2019-01-25 12:25:49	Moongoodboy{K}	And more fearless.
2019-01-25 12:26:04	projektir	What is C good for atm? Web servers? Games? Embedded? 
2019-01-25 12:26:06	june	Some concrete examples: C is still better than Rust at a) fixed size arrays, b) compile-time constants, c) static assertions
2019-01-25 12:26:23	projektir	june: those are all very specific things. They don't matter. What matters is what you build with it.
2019-01-25 12:26:27	projektir	What things are good to build with C?
2019-01-25 12:26:47	sarnold	operating system kernels
2019-01-25 12:26:59	sarnold	thoguh the linux CVE history might suggest otherwise..
2019-01-25 12:27:15	projektir	I can see that, yes, but mostly due to C's power differential, not its simplicity.
2019-01-25 12:27:34	 *	june looks at the myriad entire operating systems built with C
2019-01-25 12:27:47	sarnold	I haven't got a clue how you'd express something like the read-copy-update algorithms in rust ...
2019-01-25 12:28:10	projektir	Idk what those are so can't help you there. :)
2019-01-25 12:28:28	june	C is good for building anything that closely interacts with the operating system

2019-01-25 12:29:20	sarnold	god the contortions poor go programmers have to go through to write anything close the OS.. ow..
2019-01-25 12:29:30	Moongoodboy{K}	C doesn't have good compile-time constants.
2019-01-25 12:29:32	projektir	Isn't that mostly for historical reasons?
2019-01-25 12:29:35	Moongoodboy{K}	#define doesn't make good constants.
2019-01-25 12:29:36	sarnold	rust *could* be good for that but the standard library went for OS-agnostic-ish instead..
2019-01-25 12:29:49	projektir	I.e., C got there first so lots of those things assume it *ahem* POSIX *ahem*.
2019-01-25 12:29:51	Astraea	and in the micro controller world, C (or C++, and at some point Rust) are very important
2019-01-25 12:29:56	june	C is good for building PNG optimizers and generators, colour scheme generators, hexdump tools, IRC clients, collaborative ASCII art projects, 2048 games, 
2019-01-25 12:29:57	Astraea	that is very true
2019-01-25 12:29:58	Moongoodboy{K}	Arrays are strictly more powerful in Rust than in C.
2019-01-25 12:30:12	projektir	Astraea: yeah that seems to be one of the areas you can't get rid of C in.
2019-01-25 12:30:18	june	Moongoodboy{K}: fuck off with #define, I'm talking about enum
2019-01-25 12:30:37	Moongoodboy{K}	june: fuck off with #define?? But #define is /fundamental/ to C!
2019-01-25 12:30:44	june	It's really not
2019-01-25 12:30:48	projektir	I basically just don't want to go to anything so low that Rust would no longer work. :P
2019-01-25 12:30:53	sarnold	june: hey time for us to part ways! 'enum' in C always felt awkward to me. :)
2019-01-25 12:31:05	Astraea	then again some micro controllers don't even get C
2019-01-25 12:31:11	Astraea	it's weird assembly or nothing
2019-01-25 12:31:12	Astraea	=P
2019-01-25 12:31:13	Moongoodboy{K}	Anyway, enums are also strictly more powerful in Rust
2019-01-25 12:31:20	murarth	C preprocessor is the worst thing ever.
2019-01-25 12:31:29	Moongoodboy{K}	I wouldn't call them /compiletime constants/ though
2019-01-25 12:31:34	june	Moongoodboy{K}: enums in Rust are not the even the same kind of thing as enum is in C
2019-01-25 12:31:42	Moongoodboy{K}	june: They can be.
2019-01-25 12:31:45	june	sarnold: what's awkward about enum
2019-01-25 12:31:47	Astraea	murarth: you should see some of the horrors I've written in the preprocessor...
2019-01-25 12:31:56	Moongoodboy{K}	We even call them “C-like enums” sometimes.

2019-01-25 12:34:07	WindowsBunny	for FFI purposes, when working with C enums, constants are the correct approach
2019-01-25 12:34:19	june	Much better to think of it primarily as a const-defining syntax than a type-defining syntax imo
2019-01-25 12:34:26	sarnold	WindowsBunny: even with manually-assigned numbers and repr(C)?
2019-01-25 12:34:39	WindowsBunny	sarnold: constants still better
2019-01-25 12:35:04	sarnold	june: I mean sure you get the symbolic names back out with gdb etc.. but strace knows how to show me names for magic numbers, even bitfields, so... ;)
2019-01-25 12:35:08	sarnold	WindowsBunny: thanks
2019-01-25 12:35:17	WindowsBunny	sarnold: because 1. many C enums are used as bitflags 2. the C side is free to add new variants which if Rust received them would be UB and 3. constants save so much compile time
2019-01-25 12:35:20	projektir	I think my big gap with most people who like C is that I fundamentally don't view programming as merely a fun exercise.

2019-01-25 13:26:09	Gilfoyle	Honestly now that I think on it
2019-01-25 13:26:16	Gilfoyle	The JVM is fairly fast and portable
2019-01-25 13:26:20	Gilfoyle	Core language is good

2019-01-25 09:13:10	nagisa_w	because for `rr` the limitation is inaccurate/missing perfcounters.
2019-01-25 09:15:02	nagisa_w	so either msvc’s time travel debugger does less of something or it just ignores the fact that the counters are inaccurate and may record nonsense.

2019-01-25 13:24:07	--	Notice(u): ⤷ Raymond Hill creator of uBlock Origin ("uBO") and uMatrix said that they will not exist on Chrome in the next months if Chrome maintains this orientation, they would only be available on Firefox. : firefox
2019-01-25 13:24:31	lp	apparantly spectre mitigations could cause serious problems with ad blocking itself
2019-01-25 13:25:03	Xion	wat
2019-01-25 13:25:09	Xion	What has one to do with the other lol
2019-01-25 13:25:46	lp	Xion: basically, webextensions code now needs to be completely isolated from website code
2019-01-25 13:26:14	lp	which means certain call sites in ad blockers has to go over threads
2019-01-25 13:26:23	Xion	Also, I'm not particularly charitable to this guy that evidently uses the misrepresented-as-usual 'zomg Chrome bad' narrative as free publicity for his project
2019-01-25 13:26:43	Xion	That sounds great from the security PoV
2019-01-25 13:26:46	lp	the alternative is to literally just implement ublock filter syntax as a firefox webextension API
2019-01-25 13:27:10	lp	which has its own problems
2019-01-25 13:28:25	lp	so yeah. what a mess
2019-01-25 13:28:33	lp	thanks intel, amd, and arm
2019-01-25 13:28:51	Xion	So the problem is that the shortcircuiting of branch prediction / flushing caches / whatever else OS does to hamper Spectre-like exploits would incur prohibitive performance penalty for ad blockers?
2019-01-25 13:29:13	Xion	I for one would expect that penalty to be lesser than the hit from running gazillion megabytes of JS-laden ads
2019-01-25 13:29:35	sebk	> So, if you were to have an extension (or multiple) that want to block or modify all outgoing requests, you'd need to call into all of those extensions for all Requests. Can you imagine how bad this will be for performance?
2019-01-25 13:29:38	sebk	where is the problem?
2019-01-25 13:30:16	sebk	still faster than a transparent proxy
2019-01-25 13:30:41	lp	Xion: I would think that the need for thread isolation is a result of more obscure vulnerabilities than the original spectre and meltdown
2019-01-25 13:30:46	lp	idk enough about it
2019-01-25 13:31:12	lp	annoying thing about spectre/meltdown family of vulnerabilities is that you need a goddamned PhD to truly understand what's happening
2019-01-25 13:31:58	lp	(of course, this also means your black hat hackers also need a PhD :)
2019-01-25 13:32:49	 *	joepie91 isn't really convinced by the performance argument at all
2019-01-25 13:33:19	lp	joepie91 will just early-adopt RISC-V
2019-01-25 13:33:23	lp	and be fine
2019-01-25 13:33:44	Xion	lp: TL;DR nothing is secure, everybody panic :)
2019-01-25 13:33:46	lp	you know, one thing I hadn't really thought of
2019-01-25 13:33:58	 *	sebk wonders what modifications have to be made to a browser to integrate an ad-blocker into it
2019-01-25 13:34:02	sebk	not as an extension
2019-01-25 13:34:07	sebk	but as part of the thing
2019-01-25 13:34:18	lp	what will happen when the world has moved on to better CPU microarchitecture
2019-01-25 13:34:20	joepie91	also, the 'memory usage' argument is bizarre, browsers already do nearly this exact same thing with safe browsing, with much higher entry counts
2019-01-25 13:34:26	lp	and we have all this software with stupid mitigations
2019-01-25 13:34:36	lp	that we need to rewrite for our nicer, securer cpus
2019-01-25 13:35:14	joepie91	sebk: so the thing is, *in principle* a declarative API like is being described for Chrome would be a good approach, at which point subscriptions to blocking lists are just entries being merged into the total set of filtered items
2019-01-25 13:35:47	joepie91	the problem is that ad blocking isn't just URL-based; it's a cat-and-mouse game between ad publishers and adblocker developers, so things like cosmetic blocking and more complex request analysis are sometimes necessary to effectively block ads
2019-01-25 13:36:09	joepie91	and the necessary techniques change over time (see eg. the websockets issue a while ago)
2019-01-25 13:36:31	lp	annoying thing about that sort of higher level blocking API is that you now can't have special logic
2019-01-25 13:36:46	joepie91	so to have first-class support for ad blocking in a browser, it would need to 1) provide an *extensive* declarative API (this is where Chrome is failing) and 2) continuously update that API to account for new ad delivery techniques
2019-01-25 13:36:53	lp	so now you've pissed off your power users who use extensions that go beyond ublock origin
2019-01-25 13:36:59	sebk	or block entire websites with ads…
2019-01-25 13:37:00	joepie91	(which is where Chrome will definitely fail because Google)
2019-01-25 13:37:26	lp	>continuously update that API to account for new ad delivery techniques
2019-01-25 13:37:30	lp	this seems key
2019-01-25 13:38:15	lp	I don't really trust mozilla that much as an ally in the war against ads
2019-01-25 13:38:31	sebk	yea… they run ads themself
2019-01-25 13:38:32	lp	especially as new adblock-busting methods come out
2019-01-25 13:38:43	joepie91	this is also why I don't believe the Chrome change to be well-intentioned; they're not idiots, I'm sure they're well aware of the above requirements for browser-level ad blocking, and them not implementing them suggests other reasons
2019-01-25 13:38:53	lp	software like ublock and youtube-dl can update as frequently as they want. a browser has to be a little more conservative
2019-01-25 13:39:34	lp	joepie91: yep
2019-01-25 13:39:49	lp	google wants to control content blocking, that's obvious at this point
2019-01-25 13:40:12	joepie91	to you and me perhaps, but I've seen plenty of people defend the proposal on the basis of "but performance!" so it is evidently an effective smokescreen :)

2019-01-25 14:07:30	joepie91	you literally cannot reliably prove that you hold a particular piece of data, efficiently
2019-01-25 14:07:37	lp	and you've just lost a bunch of important data despite being a seemingly reliable node
2019-01-25 14:07:45	joepie91	and that's a prerequisite for the replication required in trustless storage systems
2019-01-25 14:08:03	joepie91	(at least, you can't prove that without having a known-good copy to hand)
2019-01-25 14:08:13	joepie91	(which defeats the point)
2019-01-25 14:08:15	Xion	Rust-less storage systems
2019-01-25 14:08:53	joepie91	lp: the idea is that you replicate to enough independent nodes that data persists even if many of them suddenly go away
2019-01-25 14:08:59	sebk	if you want safe storage: hire an IT dep
2019-01-25 14:08:59	joepie91	at which point the data gets re-replicated
2019-01-25 14:09:07	sebk	and two storage places
2019-01-25 14:09:15	joepie91	but for that to work, you need to be able to assess 'independent nodes' and that is where it all breaks down
2019-01-25 14:09:34	lp	good thing the asteroid impact happened before the file propagated too far in the network
2019-01-25 14:09:53	joepie91	because it is actually really difficult to design a proof scheme that's resistant to things like proxy attacks (where storage node 2 just retrieves data from storage node 1 and pretends to have it itself), over a long period of time
2019-01-25 14:10:37	lp	or rather, good thing the asteroid impact happened before said company wanted to buy enough expensive internet coins to have it stored reliably enough

2019-01-25 14:19:27	joepie91	lp: that attack is a problem if whatever economic mechanism is being used, doesn't determine whether the data is semantically meaningful to a user of the system, but just goes by "how much data do you claim to be storing that you can prove you have"
2019-01-25 14:19:47	joepie91	lp: because then you could just store nothing, generate zeroes, and claim that you're hosting a few terabytes of zeroes

2019-01-25 14:22:35	joepie91	if you can drop the "no local copy" constraint then it becomes relatively easy to prove storage, at least
2019-01-25 14:22:47	joepie91	you can just do challenge-response against a copy that's encrypted separately for each storage node
2019-01-25 14:22:53	joepie91	(the latter to prevent proxy attacks)

2019-01-25 14:29:03	joepie91	lp: anyway, the crux of the problem with proof-of-storage is this: how do you challenge a storage node to prove that they hold all of the data they claim to hold, without either having a full copy locally or retrieving all of the data every time you want to check?
2019-01-25 14:29:21	joepie91	you can't just ask for a hash of the file because that can be cached, and takes up much less space
2019-01-25 14:29:28	joepie91	so the storage node can just store the hash and not the file
2019-01-25 14:29:34	lp	ah yeah true
2019-01-25 14:29:42	lp	checking would always involve transferring the whole thing over
2019-01-25 14:29:52	joepie91	you *can* ask for a hash of random chunks of the file, but either 1) you need a local copy to generate hashes from, or 2) you need a pre-defined pool of checks, which can be exhausted
2019-01-25 14:30:19	joepie91	so you end up pretty much *needing* interactive challenge-response to verify storage long-term
2019-01-25 14:30:20	lp	well if you're file's not too big, you could just chunk-hash the whole thing
2019-01-25 14:30:40	joepie91	then the storage node could do the same
2019-01-25 14:30:58	joepie91	any effective proof-of-storage scheme must prevent the storage node from reducing the amount of storage used in a lossy manner
2019-01-25 14:34:13	lp	you need to stop naysaying, we'll have blockchains that sequence and synthesize DNA digital storage by the year 2020

2019-01-25 18:11:01	Trangar	My brain no worky
2019-01-25 18:13:18	ytain	what is MEF?
2019-01-25 18:13:28	dgriffen	Managed Extensibility Framework
2019-01-25 18:13:44	dgriffen	basically I can mark types with [Export] and other types can [Import] them
2019-01-25 18:13:57	ytain	oh ok
2019-01-25 18:14:28	Trangar	So basically the C ABI
2019-01-25 18:14:52	dgriffen	kinda? Except you can do more advanced composition
2019-01-25 18:15:04	dgriffen	Exporting types can have their own imports
2019-01-25 18:15:19	dgriffen	And you can import many so you can get a list of every exporter of a certain interface
2019-01-25 18:15:22	sebk	hm…
2019-01-25 18:16:11	dgriffen	Its a bit more powerful in C# since it works based on runtime reflection, Rust would work entirely at compile time
2019-01-25 18:20:18	Trangar	I still want to make a runtime reflection library in rust
2019-01-25 18:20:44	dgriffen	Would it work with dynamic linking though?
2019-01-25 18:20:57	Trangar	I could probably make it work
2019-01-25 18:21:18	dgriffen	Since that's what makes MEF so awesome, I can just drop down a dll and its exports get picked up

2019-01-25 19:31:47	Trangar	Dutch people don't smoke weed, that's only for tourists
2019-01-25 19:32:02	Trangar	I don't know a single person above like 22 who smokes weed
2019-01-25 19:32:13	Trangar	We kind of try it when we hit 18 and then decide it's kind of boring
2019-01-25 19:32:23	Trangar	And makes your mouth taste like an ash tray in the morning
2019-01-25 19:32:34	dgriffen	so many of my coworkers in Seattle do... kinda weird
2019-01-25 19:32:43	Trangar	Right, because weed's new there

2019-01-25 19:34:37	dgriffen	eijebong: yes
2019-01-25 19:34:41	eijebong	You resold the mobile Nokia stuff ?
2019-01-25 19:34:48	dgriffen	idk
2019-01-25 19:35:07	Trangar	MS did quit their mobile line 
2019-01-25 19:35:32	Amaranth	Even if they didn't sell it the MS only got permission to sell things under the Nokia brand for like 5 years, after that Nokia got it back
2019-01-25 19:35:52	Amaranth	Nokia then licensed it to a company that I think has old Nokia mobile people doing design and they make Android phones
2019-01-25 19:36:05	eijebong	Yeah HMD ? Because that's Nokia too
2019-01-25 19:37:01	Amaranth	So at this point MS would have the people and buildings and such if they still own it but coudln't make a new Nokia phone, it'd have to be a MS (probably Surface branded) phone
2019-01-25 19:37:35	Trangar	I should get a MS surfce
2019-01-25 19:37:37	Trangar	They seem really good

2019-01-25 19:49:12	Trangar	I think vaping / weed bowls are fine

2019-01-25 19:52:05	lp	blunts (tobacco leaf paper) and normal joints (just hemp paper) are way more common than joints with tobacco mixed in

2019-01-25 19:52:25	Astraea	yeah, it's pretty rare to see joints with tobacco mixed in around here
2019-01-25 19:52:52	Astraea	pre-bought or rolled by hand

2019-01-25 19:53:04	lp	(that is, hemp paper + weed + tobacco)
2019-01-25 19:53:32	Astraea	might be because in most parts of the US cigarettes are pretty cheap compared to europe?
2019-01-25 19:53:42	Trangar	I think nicotine makes the high stronger if you're not used to it

2019-01-25 20:35:42	dgriffen	Do you expect users to have libressl on their system?
2019-01-25 20:36:21	june	Well, this is Linux, so the only safe assumption of how the user got LibreSSL is by installing it manually
2019-01-25 20:36:23	nagisa	always statically link.

2019-01-25 20:36:38	june	(because distros suck at packaging alternative implementations of libssl)

2019-01-25 22:03:50	dgriffen	calculator programming was best programming
2019-01-25 22:03:52	dgriffen	fite me
2019-01-25 22:04:39	fwiw	computer is actually just a big calculator :)
2019-01-25 22:05:05	dgriffen	TI-84 was the real pc
2019-01-25 22:05:22	KiChjang	you know there's no difference between calculator and computer in mainland china
2019-01-25 22:05:34	KiChjang	both of them are called 计算机
2019-01-25 22:05:50	Aceeri	how do you distinguish
2019-01-25 22:06:07	KiChjang	it's only taiwan (or *ahem* republic of china) who invented the term electronic brain
2019-01-25 22:06:12	KiChjang	电脑
2019-01-25 22:06:32	KiChjang	but most people use electronic brain nowadays to say computer
2019-01-25 22:07:08	KiChjang	which gives rise to some interesting colloqualisms
2019-01-25 22:07:14	fwiw	my electronic brain freeze
2019-01-25 22:07:22	KiChjang	if your computer hangs, it's because it's thinking too hard
2019-01-25 22:07:56	Aceeri	there were already 2 crashes on the I5 today
2019-01-25 22:07:56	Aceeri	fuck
2019-01-25 22:08:07	Aceeri	I just want to get home in a reasonable amount of time please thank you
2019-01-25 22:08:31	fwiw	ur welcome
2019-01-25 22:08:55	Aceeri	I guarantee you it was a driver that was too stupid to put more than 2 feet from the person infront of them
2019-01-25 22:09:30	Aceeri	its like 50/50 here where 50% of people can't understand that having space between you and the car infront makes your life and everyone else's life easier
2019-01-25 22:10:08	Aceeri	or they were going 95mph and weaving inbetween traffic because they are "good" drivers
2019-01-25 22:10:12	Aceeri	and then they hit someone and spin out
2019-01-25 22:10:19	nagisa	KiChjang: well, what do you with calculator? compute!
2019-01-25 22:10:23	nagisa	so calculator = computer
2019-01-25 22:10:40	nagisa	I call my computers calculators sometimes
2019-01-25 22:11:14	KiChjang	there's no such problem in japanese i believe
2019-01-25 22:11:23	KiChjang	because computer is just konpyutaa
2019-01-25 22:11:44	KiChjang	or was it konpyuutaa?
2019-01-25 22:12:04	&niconii	konpyuutaa or konpyuuta
2019-01-25 22:12:11	Aceeri	nyanpyuutaa obviously
2019-01-25 22:12:20	nagisa	KiChjang: 計算機 can be used in japanese to refer to either
2019-01-25 22:12:22	Aceeri	because we only uses them to view cat pics
2019-01-25 22:12:26	KiChjang	oh huh

2019-01-25 22:12:50	KiChjang	wtf?
2019-01-25 22:12:53	nagisa	keisanki.
2019-01-25 22:12:56	&niconii	keisanki
2019-01-25 22:12:58	KiChjang	that's what i thought

2019-01-25 22:14:05	KiChjang	es ist gut
2019-01-25 22:14:23	&niconii	calculator is 電卓 (dentaku) which is short for 電子式卓上計算機 (denshishiki takujou keisanki, electronic tabletop calculator)

2019-01-25 22:15:28	KiChjang	man, japanese specialized terms are all just chinese
2019-01-25 22:15:31	nagisa	did japanese perhaps not put their computers on top of their table or what?
2019-01-25 22:15:55	&niconii	it's probably talking about, y'know, computers that took up a whole room
2019-01-25 22:16:04	KiChjang	well, there are tower configs
2019-01-25 22:16:12	&niconii	i doubt anyone uses anything other than "konpyuuta" anymore
2019-01-25 22:16:19	KiChjang	and you put your tower on the floor instead of the table
2019-01-25 22:16:22	&niconii	or "pasokon", short for personal computer
2019-01-25 22:16:36	KiChjang	but i thought pasokon is only used for laptops
2019-01-25 22:16:42	nagisa	pasokon is what I hear used most of the time

2019-01-25 23:28:29	Trangar	Yes sir
2019-01-25 23:28:30	dgriffen	sarnold: probably baguettes
2019-01-25 23:28:44	Trangar	I'm okay with baguettes, I love bread
2019-01-25 23:28:57	eijebong	Nah, rice and pork chops with cream and mustard

2019-01-25 23:29:47	KiChjang	i have cheese raclette at home rn
2019-01-25 23:30:04	KiChjang	and i throw them in the oven to broil them every now and then
2019-01-25 23:30:34	KiChjang	for some reason they're more salty after they're broiled
2019-01-25 23:30:42	KiChjang	or rather, after they're melted
2019-01-25 23:31:14	eijebong	Chheeeeeeeeese
2019-01-25 23:33:33	KiChjang	i also have emmentalier
2019-01-25 23:34:06	KiChjang	they don't taste as nice when you broil them
2019-01-25 23:34:19	KiChjang	in fact it became pretty oily after heating up
2019-01-25 23:34:34	eijebong	"emmentalier" ? Emmental ?
2019-01-25 23:34:37	KiChjang	well, no, it still tastes good

2019-01-25 23:35:48	eijebong	Actually I'm going to make pasta
2019-01-25 23:35:51	fmtq	so even though 90% of people probably would become pepe anime people I don't have to deal with the system here 
2019-01-25 23:35:51	fmtq	lol
2019-01-25 23:35:55	eijebong	And put emmental on it !
2019-01-25 23:36:11	fmtq	the problem with modernity is the controlled systems of expression that promote certain behaviours
2019-01-25 23:36:16	fmtq	and I dislike it
2019-01-25 23:36:26	projektir	I would judge BBSs by how big the avatar sizes are.
2019-01-25 23:36:32	projektir	100x100 is too big.
2019-01-25 23:36:40	eijebong	My ear is itchy af >_<
2019-01-25 23:36:42	fmtq	also I advise against box royal switches
2019-01-25 23:36:46	fmtq	faaaar too tactile
2019-01-25 23:36:46	 *	eijebong scratches
2019-01-25 23:36:53	projektir	But why you need avatars for chat I got no idea.
2019-01-25 23:36:56	fmtq	so tactile it pushes your finger up a bit when it has been pressed down 
2019-01-25 23:37:17	fmtq	it makes you feel like, well, the onyl way to explain si if you drive on a very bumpy road for a long period of time
2019-01-25 23:37:24	dgriffen	projektir: because clearly reading a name is too hard
2019-01-25 23:37:25	fmtq	your hands feel it all and then buzz for a while after you stop driving
2019-01-25 23:37:33	fmtq	it's like that when you type
2019-01-25 23:37:47	projektir	I like my blues.
2019-01-25 23:37:49	fmtq	also my iris project was a failure because there seems to be some kind of fault in the PCB, so much cross chatter, but also sometimes no chatter.
2019-01-25 23:37:50	CognitiveRadiation	fmtq: I have some bad news for you about pre-modernity and controlled systems of expressions that promote certain behaviors
2019-01-25 23:37:52	projektir	I very like my blues.
2019-01-25 23:38:02	fmtq	CognitiveRadiation: I doubt you have any useful news for me tbh 
2019-01-25 23:38:08	CognitiveRadiation	that'st rue
2019-01-25 23:38:10	CognitiveRadiation	*true
2019-01-25 23:38:12	CognitiveRadiation	we can't go back to the past
2019-01-25 23:38:22	CognitiveRadiation	we are stuck in the now
2019-01-25 23:38:24	projektir	Eh, things tend to go in circles.
2019-01-25 23:38:35	fmtq	they do indeed 
2019-01-25 23:38:38	projektir	So we might end up going to the past once people realize how shit some of this stuff is...
2019-01-25 23:38:42	fmtq	yes
2019-01-25 23:38:48	projektir	I kinda want to build a forum software.
2019-01-25 23:38:54	projektir	But that requires me to be non-lazy.
2019-01-25 23:38:56	fmtq	sounds tedious 
2019-01-25 23:38:57	CognitiveRadiation	I think phpbb still exists
2019-01-25 23:38:59	projektir	Which is a difficult.
2019-01-25 23:39:00	fmtq	having written a blague 
2019-01-25 23:39:03	CognitiveRadiation	someone should add activitypub support to phpbb
2019-01-25 23:39:04	projektir	Fuck phpbb
2019-01-25 23:39:08	projektir	that was never good forum software
2019-01-25 23:39:11	fmtq	lol 
2019-01-25 23:39:11	projektir	always shit
2019-01-25 23:39:13	CognitiveRadiation	I have nostaligc memories of phpbb bulletin boards
2019-01-25 23:39:14	fmtq	was it a forum though
2019-01-25 23:39:17	CognitiveRadiation	but also yes you are not wrong
2019-01-25 23:39:22	fmtq	the only ones I liked were vbulletin I think 
2019-01-25 23:39:28	projektir	yeah i prefer vbulletin
2019-01-25 23:39:30	projektir	but it's also not great
2019-01-25 23:39:32	projektir	very bulky
2019-01-25 23:39:35	fmtq	ezboard
2019-01-25 23:39:36	projektir	i moderated on vbulletin, too
2019-01-25 23:39:37	projektir	meh
2019-01-25 23:39:47	fmtq	fucking ezboard

2019-01-25 23:40:00	projektir	decent forum, too
2019-01-25 23:40:07	projektir	but vbulletin is so old
2019-01-25 23:40:07	CognitiveRadiation	anyway I think that the real problem is peoples' political behavior as mediated by their ability to communicate with other people in their political community
2019-01-25 23:40:11	projektir	i'm sure we could improve on that
2019-01-25 23:40:29	sarnold	I read the vbulletin sources once, would not recommend
2019-01-25 23:40:38	fmtq	how hard is it to make a goddamn forum 
2019-01-25 23:40:41	projektir	vbullet in was iffy to customize and moderate
2019-01-25 23:40:42	fmtq	it's pagination with comments
2019-01-25 23:40:44	CognitiveRadiation	not hard!
2019-01-25 23:40:45	projektir	fmtq: you'd think not hard
2019-01-25 23:40:48	projektir	why I want to try it
2019-01-25 23:40:50	CognitiveRadiation	you could probably knock one out in a week
2019-01-25 23:40:52	projektir	excuse to learn more rust stuff :D
2019-01-25 23:40:58	fmtq	true 
2019-01-25 23:41:00	CognitiveRadiation	what *really* matters is what demographics of people are participating in your forum
2019-01-25 23:41:01	projektir	but also need UI
2019-01-25 23:41:02	CognitiveRadiation	and which aren't
2019-01-25 23:41:11	projektir	CognitiveRadiation: forum software matters a little IMO
2019-01-25 23:41:13	CognitiveRadiation	since that affects what words get written
2019-01-25 23:41:16	projektir	phbb always felt flimsier

2019-01-25 23:43:02	fmtq	ezboard was written in Smalltalk VisualWorks 3.1 by Vanchau Nguyen with Jay O'Connor.[29] There was no database used on the back-end, but instead a built-in flat-file object-oriented datastore (BOSS) which together with the overall power of the Smalltalk language made the code fast and compact for the time.

2019-01-25 23:45:21	dgriffen	UMBRELLAS!?
2019-01-25 23:45:34	projektir	he hated umberllas
2019-01-25 23:45:36	sarnold	fuckin embrallas

2019-01-25 23:46:17	projektir	you're not supposed to use umbrellas
2019-01-25 23:46:35	dgriffen	yeah, my coworkers made fun of me the one time I did
2019-01-25 23:46:38	KiChjang	sarnold: i guess i didn't explain how chinese censorship works in here before, but the short answer is it doesn't
2019-01-25 23:47:04	KiChjang	there is no law nor written rule on what is considered banned speech
2019-01-25 23:47:50	sarnold	KiChjang: no winny the pooh, no umbrellas, no discussion of ... june 9 was it?
2019-01-25 23:47:57	KiChjang	so what happens is that the central government may have set the censorship level to 40, but lower rungs of the government may increase it to level 50, 60 or 70
2019-01-25 23:48:07	CognitiveRadiation	I saw an article recently about chinese ISPs having to teach their employees about the real version of controversial chinese history
2019-01-25 23:48:11	CognitiveRadiation	so they knew what to ban
2019-01-25 23:48:14	KiChjang	because they wanna play it conservative so that the upper levels don't give them shit
2019-01-25 23:48:34	CognitiveRadiation	and so people going into these jobs were like "wait, *that's* what happened in the june 4th incident?"
2019-01-25 23:48:46	KiChjang	there's also no central organization that oversees censorship

2019-01-25 23:49:24	KiChjang	i suspect running and overseeing are two different functions
2019-01-25 23:49:34	sarnold	oh, makes sense..
2019-01-25 23:49:58	KiChjang	but response are varied, it may be the local public security bureau that "invites you for tea"
2019-01-25 23:50:04	KiChjang	or it maybe the local party cell
2019-01-25 23:50:07	KiChjang	or it may be the police
2019-01-25 23:50:16	KiChjang	there is no set rule
2019-01-25 23:50:37	CognitiveRadiation	I hear about things like this happening in europe with regards to anti-immigrant comments online
2019-01-25 23:50:42	CognitiveRadiation	specifically in the UK and sweden
2019-01-25 23:50:47	sarnold	interesting that country that's pretty big on centralized management would delegate these responsibilities ;)
2019-01-25 23:50:49	KiChjang	i also hear that the winnie the pooh comparison was actually made by a state media outlet at first
2019-01-25 23:50:55	projektir	KiChjang is getting pulled into an argument and it isn't even my fault.
2019-01-25 23:50:58	sarnold	:D
2019-01-25 23:51:02	CognitiveRadiation	xi jinping really does kinda look like winnie the pooh
2019-01-25 23:51:19	KiChjang	projektir: wasn't arguing; was explaining
2019-01-25 23:51:33	fmtq	go straight to prison CognitiveRadiation
2019-01-25 23:51:50	KiChjang	that's not how the censor works; it blocks your message
2019-01-25 23:51:55	KiChjang	and you don't get notified
2019-01-25 23:52:09	KiChjang	the other person would not receive what you wrote
2019-01-25 23:52:27	projektir	So you all live in different versions of reality.

2019-01-25 23:53:11	fmtq	Chinese censorship is quite interesting 
2019-01-25 23:53:12	projektir	More news at 11.
2019-01-25 23:53:19	KiChjang	sarnold: the "big on centralized government" is what the central government wants everyone else to believe
2019-01-25 23:53:20	CognitiveRadiation	I have the idea that censorship on the chinese internet is sorta like torrenting
2019-01-25 23:53:36	KiChjang	but in reality they don't have as much control as they want you to believe
2019-01-25 23:53:38	CognitiveRadiation	in that, people can get around it, but you have to be somewhat technically inclined to do so
2019-01-25 23:53:44	CognitiveRadiation	but that's enough of a barrier that most people don't
2019-01-25 23:53:46	KiChjang	especially when it comes to village-level governance
2019-01-25 23:53:50	KiChjang	they've completely lost it
2019-01-25 23:54:04	fmtq	unless you're an Uyghur

2019-01-26 00:50:51	panicbit	right now I need the foods to be somewhat useable
2019-01-26 00:50:54	Amaranth	I mean, if it can keep it up it's TRIGGER style with A-1 production quality and is apparently really funny
2019-01-26 00:51:03	KiChjang	one for mainland china, one for taiwan
2019-01-26 00:51:03	CognitiveRadiation	also I don't have japanese language IME set up on my work laptop

2019-01-26 00:51:19	KiChjang	and in fact taiwan doesn't exactly call it as i described
2019-01-26 00:51:21	Amaranth	But I can see why it'd be super hyped on reddit
2019-01-26 00:51:22	projektir	I'm feeling sick-ish and debating if I can go bouldering or not...

2019-01-26 00:51:55	jebrosen	Oh, that's AV isn't it?
2019-01-26 00:51:57	panicbit	things froze

2019-01-26 00:52:45	panicbit	and after a while I was able to see the keyboard layout settings again

2019-01-26 00:56:28	panicbit	I never want to offend anyone
2019-01-26 00:56:28	Soni	panicbit: what's an special needs?
2019-01-26 00:56:32	CognitiveRadiation	"special needs" is a euphemism

2019-01-26 00:56:53	CognitiveRadiation	just like "retarded" and "idiot"
2019-01-26 00:56:54	Soni	is it one of those fancy ableist insults?
2019-01-26 00:57:06	Soni	ah, yeah it is
2019-01-26 00:57:07	panicbit	yes
2019-01-26 00:57:08	CognitiveRadiation	but they keep ending up being used to refer to ordinary things derogtorily
2019-01-26 00:57:12	jebrosen	Only in IE, of course, which doesn't have Node.remove()
2019-01-26 00:57:25	CognitiveRadiation	so people who want to talk about actually intellectually-disabled people have to keep switching the euphemism they use
2019-01-26 00:57:34	Soni	panicbit: yeah don't worry about calling IE special needs, I give you complete freedom to call IE special needs
2019-01-26 00:57:37	panicbit	jebrosen: or has different defaults for flex
2019-01-26 00:57:45	CognitiveRadiation	I actually think "intellectually disabled" might have some staying power, because it's such a long and awkward phrase
2019-01-26 00:57:48	Soni	just don't use it to imply IE has anything to do with disabled ppl
2019-01-26 00:58:11	panicbit	jebrosen: or requires you to put body { height: 100vh; } even though it is min-height: 100vh already
2019-01-26 00:58:13	CognitiveRadiation	staying power as the word you use for people with actual intellectual disabilities
2019-01-26 00:58:17	Soni	(or vice-versa)
2019-01-26 00:58:17	jebrosen	Hahahah flex. Caniuse says that IE's partial support rating is due to "numerous issues with flex support"
2019-01-26 00:58:22	panicbit	fuck
2019-01-26 00:58:23	panicbit	I
2019-01-26 00:58:24	CognitiveRadiation	I guess "special needs" is vague and could refer to people with only physical disabilities
2019-01-26 00:58:24	panicbit	E
2019-01-26 00:58:28	Soni	hmm...
2019-01-26 00:58:31	projektir	Lots of people have disabilities or differences that are not intellectual, though.
2019-01-26 00:58:38	panicbit	CognitiveRadiation: Yes, it's a poor choice of words
2019-01-26 00:58:43	CognitiveRadiation	but I think of it as referring primarily to people with intellectual disabilities
2019-01-26 00:58:44	panicbit	I am very sorry
2019-01-26 00:58:50	projektir	CognitiveRadiation: hmm, I don't.
2019-01-26 00:58:50	panicbit	I take that back
2019-01-26 00:59:02	panicbit	No human deserves to be compared with IE
2019-01-26 00:59:05	projektir	Like, is ADHD an intellectual disability?
2019-01-26 00:59:07	Soni	IE is the special needs browser because it's the special choice of companies who need it for their "designed for IE6" webpages
2019-01-26 00:59:08	projektir	panicbit: lol
2019-01-26 00:59:11	CognitiveRadiation	projektir: if it's sever enough yeah
2019-01-26 00:59:14	CognitiveRadiation	*severe
2019-01-26 00:59:18	panicbit	projektir: uwu
2019-01-26 00:59:19	CognitiveRadiation	so is autism
2019-01-26 00:59:22	projektir	CognitiveRadiation: but it's often fixable with a pill.
2019-01-26 00:59:33	Soni	"severe enough"
2019-01-26 00:59:37	projektir	And some people who have it are very strong intellectually (I knew one).
2019-01-26 00:59:38	CognitiveRadiation	so is schizophrenia
2019-01-26 00:59:45	Soni	*sticks co2 loads up CognitiveRadiation's nose*
2019-01-26 01:00:05	CognitiveRadiation	and that's good, being able to fix medical problems with pills is better than not being able to
2019-01-26 01:00:11	projektir	Yes.
2019-01-26 01:00:34	Soni	who are you calling a medical problem ¬_¬

2019-01-26 01:00:59	CognitiveRadiation	I'm not aware of any ADHD people who complain about negative effects from the medication they take to control it, like I am with schizophrenic people who complain about anti-schizophrenia medicine
2019-01-26 01:01:01	projektir	I'm a medical problem.

2019-01-26 01:01:52	projektir	My brain, on the other hand...

2019-01-26 01:05:42	Soni	KiChjang: I'm saying Edge's existence as separate from chrome's rendering engine was a good thing
2019-01-26 01:05:51	panicbit	also, you are totally seeing it the wrong way
2019-01-26 01:05:58	Soni	but now they're just gonna use chrome internally
2019-01-26 01:05:59	KiChjang	that's microsoft's choice for giving up
2019-01-26 01:06:06	panicbit	it's not like they are forcng people to use blink
2019-01-26 01:06:12	panicbit	it's just that other engines suck
2019-01-26 01:06:14	KiChjang	and besides, microsoft isn't a founding member of WHATWG
2019-01-26 01:06:25	KiChjang	and has never really contributed to it
2019-01-26 01:06:27	Soni	so what?
2019-01-26 01:06:37	panicbit	Soni: So your point is moot
2019-01-26 01:06:38	panicbit	fck you
2019-01-26 01:06:44	panicbit	nuff said
2019-01-26 01:06:47	KiChjang	so it was their problem for not conforming in the first place
2019-01-26 01:06:53	panicbit	correct
2019-01-26 01:06:56	KiChjang	do you want the world to bend down to microsoft instead?
2019-01-26 01:06:56	Soni	I'm not gonna contribute to WHATWG, I'll just make my own webpages using my own proprietary crap and let WHATWG figure it out themselves
2019-01-26 01:07:02	Soni	that's how you do the web
2019-01-26 01:07:05	KiChjang	no
2019-01-26 01:07:06	jebrosen	???
2019-01-26 01:07:09	KiChjang	that's NOT how you do the web
2019-01-26 01:07:15	Soni	you make a client that's specifically for one page because you need one feature on that one page
2019-01-26 01:07:23	KiChjang	that's how everyone eventually figured out it was a bad thing to do
2019-01-26 01:07:26	Soni	then you let everyone else figure it out
2019-01-26 01:07:28	panicbit	Soni: that's active x for you
2019-01-26 01:07:41	Soni	panicbit: I just want some public keys
2019-01-26 01:07:46	panicbit	you can have those
2019-01-26 01:07:47	Soni	they won't give me public keys
2019-01-26 01:07:49	panicbit	it's in the standard
2019-01-26 01:07:51	Soni	so I'll make them
2019-01-26 01:07:55	panicbit	stop being idiotic
2019-01-26 01:08:00	Soni	panicbit: it's literally not
2019-01-26 01:08:05	panicbit	it's literally yes
2019-01-26 01:08:06	panicbit	fuck off
2019-01-26 01:08:17	Soni	the standard suggests I send the private key in plaintext to the server
2019-01-26 01:08:39	KiChjang	i'm pretty sure no sane person or organization would suggest you to do so
2019-01-26 01:08:51	Soni	KiChjang: then why do all of them do?
2019-01-26 01:08:55	KiChjang	if you can point me to the spec where it says so
2019-01-26 01:08:58	KiChjang	i can file a bug for you
2019-01-26 01:09:03	Soni	passwords, private keys, what's the difference
2019-01-26 01:09:15	Amaranth	The IE11/Edge split just made the last of Microsoft's browser marketshare get split in half and Edge was usually still too slow at implementing new standards
2019-01-26 01:09:23	Soni	actually passwords are arguably master keys with all the key reuse and stuff
2019-01-26 01:09:37	Soni	password reuse* rather
2019-01-26 01:09:40	KiChjang	Soni: html.spec.whatwg.org, where is it?
2019-01-26 01:09:41	Soni	not that there's a difference
2019-01-26 01:09:46	Amaranth	And they've already got experience making a WebKit/Blink browser with their iOS and Android apps
2019-01-26 01:09:49	Soni	KiChjang: look for <input type="password">
2019-01-26 01:10:09	KiChjang	so #htmlinputelement?

2019-01-26 01:11:48	Soni	"User agents must not allow users to insert U+000A LINE FEED (LF) or U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) characters into the value."
2019-01-26 01:11:50	Soni	seriously why
2019-01-26 01:11:55	Soni	eh w/e
2019-01-26 01:12:11	KiChjang	what do you mean why
2019-01-26 01:12:14	fmtq	lol
2019-01-26 01:12:16	sarnold	because then users would add Host: values and so on
2019-01-26 01:12:16	fmtq	don't
2019-01-26 01:12:18	KiChjang	you think multiline passwords make sense?
2019-01-26 01:12:19	Soni	"The input element represents a one line plain text edit control for the element's value."
2019-01-26 01:12:31	Soni	anyway this says the password is sent to the server in plain text
2019-01-26 01:12:34	KiChjang	no
2019-01-26 01:12:37	KiChjang	you're reading it wrong
2019-01-26 01:12:48	KiChjang	it didn't say "send the password to the server as plaintext"
2019-01-26 01:12:54	KiChjang	it says "this is a plaintext editor control"
2019-01-26 01:12:56	Soni	(with the only thing between you and an attacker being TLS. which is useless if the attacker is the server, as in phishing attacks.)
2019-01-26 01:13:20	KiChjang	seriously this isn't rocket science
2019-01-26 01:13:23	panicbit	Soni: meanwhile, I'm sorry for insulting you
2019-01-26 01:13:24	Soni	KiChjang: exactly, and what happens when you submit the form?
2019-01-26 01:13:44	KiChjang	Soni: it either did not specify, or it follows fetch.spec.whatwg.org
2019-01-26 01:14:01	Amaranth	Soni: Whatever you say should happen in your JS form handler
2019-01-26 01:14:13	projektir	So I have a webcam mounted pointed at my face now.
2019-01-26 01:14:21	projektir	Part of me is like "I should probably move it down".
2019-01-26 01:14:21	panicbit	I tried to call the sublecrypto api's on FF and it didn't work :I
2019-01-26 01:14:24	Soni	Amaranth: what's a JS?
2019-01-26 01:14:25	KiChjang	i'm dubious that it will mandate a format
2019-01-26 01:14:26	june	anyone know off the top of their head how to lower the menu timeout in GRUB 2?
2019-01-26 01:14:33	projektir	The other part is "it took so long to find the perfect position for it on my monitor".
2019-01-26 01:14:38	projektir	So now I don't want to move it.
2019-01-26 01:14:53	panicbit	june: something in the /etc/default/grub
2019-01-26 01:14:54	jebrosen	june: is it GRUB_MENU_TIMEOUT?
2019-01-26 01:14:56	panicbit	or something
2019-01-26 01:15:01	june	projektir: you want to point it at your torso instead?
2019-01-26 01:15:02	panicbit	ŵhat jebrosen said
2019-01-26 01:15:20	projektir	june: that's appropriate for some developments but I'd rather just move my chair in that case.
2019-01-26 01:15:48	june	~lenny
2019-01-26 01:15:48	rustybot	( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
2019-01-26 01:15:54	Soni	in any case, the request inspector on firefox says $google is receiving my password as plaintext
2019-01-26 01:16:01	KiChjang	june: open your grub.cfg and edit GRUB_TIMEOUT
2019-01-26 01:16:06	Soni	(replace $google with any service that uses <input type="password">)
2019-01-26 01:16:14	june	KiChjang: there's no such thing
2019-01-26 01:16:26	KiChjang	no GRUB_TIMEOUT or no grub.cfg?
2019-01-26 01:16:32	june	no GRUB_TIMEOUT
2019-01-26 01:16:44	KiChjang	you add it then?
2019-01-26 01:16:46	Soni	in fact, password is "A text control that obscures data entry "
2019-01-26 01:16:51	KiChjang	that key should work
2019-01-26 01:16:53	Soni	it specifically talks about *data entry*
2019-01-26 01:16:56	sarnold	GRUB_TIMEOUT in /etc/default/grub, 'set timeout=10' in the raw grub config
2019-01-26 01:17:06	june	wait how does /etc/default/grub work
2019-01-26 01:17:11	Soni	but otherwise it's just plain text
2019-01-26 01:17:17	Amaranth	Of course the browser will complain if the form is going over HTTP so you shouldn't enter anything secure there
2019-01-26 01:17:20	KiChjang	i remember that you need to run a command to generate /etc/default/grub
2019-01-26 01:17:21	Soni	y'all can't read obviously
2019-01-26 01:17:29	jebrosen	KiChjang: other way around
2019-01-26 01:17:30	Soni	Amaranth: let's encrypt
2019-01-26 01:17:35	Soni	Amaranth: phishing is easy nowadays
2019-01-26 01:17:38	 *	projektir scratched their eye a bit too hard
2019-01-26 01:17:39	projektir	ow
2019-01-26 01:17:39	Soni	well, it's always been easy
2019-01-26 01:17:49	panicbit	Soni: yeah, type="password" is not what you are searching for
2019-01-26 01:17:51	june	so what do I need to do something after changing /etc/default/grub ?
2019-01-26 01:17:53	Amaranth	And if it's over HTTPS it might be plaintext inside HTTP but the whole transmission is covered by TLS
2019-01-26 01:17:54	Soni	I'm the only one trying to fix it
2019-01-26 01:18:04	sarnold	june: there's an update-grub or grub-mkconfig command that turns the /etc/default/grub configuration into "real" grub configuration. because of course there is.
2019-01-26 01:18:09	Amaranth	You're trying to fix a problem we identified and fixed in 1995
2019-01-26 01:18:10	Soni	Amaranth: the server is malicious
2019-01-26 01:18:19	Amaranth	If the server is malicious you're fucked
2019-01-26 01:18:19	Soni	Amaranth: there's no MITM
2019-01-26 01:18:29	jebrosen	grub-mkconfig (or update-grub or whatever on Debian) generates grub.cfg from /etc/default/grub and piles of scripts and autodetection
2019-01-26 01:18:33	Soni	Amaranth: not with my proprietary web browser
2019-01-26 01:18:34	panicbit	There is no spoon.
2019-01-26 01:18:42	panicbit	Too bad for those spooners
2019-01-26 01:18:42	Amaranth	There is no way that is anything close to user friendly that will help you if the server is malicious
2019-01-26 01:18:57	Soni	Amaranth: you wanna try it?
2019-01-26 01:19:01	Amaranth	Actually there is just no way period
2019-01-26 01:19:11	Soni	well hmm...
2019-01-26 01:19:16	Soni	I guess I need to write an web app for it
2019-01-26 01:19:18	Amaranth	The best thing I could think of is basically cert pinning and we already do that
2019-01-26 01:19:19	sarnold	Amaranth: what problem is being solved?
2019-01-26 01:19:31	Amaranth	sarnold: Sending secure information to a malicious server
2019-01-26 01:19:34	Soni	Amaranth: doesn't pin the phishing page
2019-01-26 01:19:42	Amaranth	Like if someone hacked the server that manages google's login
2019-01-26 01:19:51	Soni	or if someone made a look-alike
2019-01-26 01:19:53	sarnold	Amaranth: hmm.. maybe SRP? https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2945
2019-01-26 01:19:59	--	Notice(u): ⤷ RFC 2945 - The SRP Authentication and Key Exchange System
2019-01-26 01:20:05	Amaranth	look-alike is covered by cert pinning
2019-01-26 01:20:18	KiChjang	yeah, i thought certs already solves this problem
2019-01-26 01:20:20	Soni	Amaranth: how, exactly?
2019-01-26 01:20:21	Amaranth	It would need to literally be the same server or someone who got access to that server to steal the certificate
2019-01-26 01:20:32	june	why is GRUB 2 so weird
2019-01-26 01:20:44	Amaranth	And if you could steal the certificate you could juse make the server malicious too anyway
2019-01-26 01:20:47	Soni	Amaranth: google.com.example.com?
2019-01-26 01:20:50	panicbit	june: "progress"
2019-01-26 01:20:56	KiChjang	just don't enter a password on a site that doesn't have the cert
2019-01-26 01:21:03	Amaranth	google.com isn't going to submit a form to google.com.example.com

2019-01-26 01:21:28	Amaranth	Otherwise it sounds like you're trying to reinvent WebCrypto
2019-01-26 01:21:48	KiChjang	i'm pretty sure this problem has been fixed
2019-01-26 01:21:55	KiChjang	and you don't know what the solution is
2019-01-26 01:21:56	Soni	Amaranth: again what's a JS?
2019-01-26 01:22:00	Soni	we don't do JS here
2019-01-26 01:22:30	panicbit	only
2019-01-26 01:22:30	Amaranth	So you want WebCrypto but managed with a new form control instead of making a JS to a browser API?

2019-01-26 01:26:14	projektir	and given how long shit takes maybe i'll be herefor another year :D
2019-01-26 01:26:17	lp	does that mean IE6 is dead?

2019-01-26 01:26:35	projektir	watch me
2019-01-26 01:26:46	projektir	this is not even my final form
2019-01-26 01:26:53	Amaranth	Firefox supports it and even has an implementation that doesn't require a smartcard (way less secure) but Google uses the API in a way that doesn't work with Firefox
2019-01-26 01:26:58	projektir	you weren't there when I interviewed 5 companies in one week
2019-01-26 01:27:02	panicbit	lp: It couldn't be deader
2019-01-26 01:27:07	Amaranth	I'm not sure if it's a Google bug, Firefox bug, or just some User-Agent checking or what

2019-01-26 01:27:47	lp	what about EdgeCountdown
2019-01-26 01:28:06	Amaranth	Unless you're maintaining an old IE6 monstronsity for some corporation you don't need to care about IE6 anymore
2019-01-26 01:28:09	panicbit	lp: the fact that there are still IE6 users is infinitely what worthy
2019-01-26 01:28:19	june	jebrosen: installing Arch yesterday I really felt like the boot loader section was lacking in straightforward instructions
2019-01-26 01:28:45	Soni	lp: that doesn't take proprietary domain-specific webapps into account
2019-01-26 01:28:49	jebrosen	june: The instructions are "go pick one and set it up, have fun" iirc
2019-01-26 01:28:55	lp	june: does it? I've always thought the arch wiki is extremely clear on pretty much all the steps
2019-01-26 01:29:06	Soni	but it's probably a good estimate for "how many of those are internet-connected"
2019-01-26 01:29:08	lp	Soni: yeah true, you can't really count those
2019-01-26 01:29:13	june	jebrosen: yeah it links to some ugly table on another page
2019-01-26 01:29:27	Soni	anyway, I'm going to bed, good night o/
2019-01-26 01:29:36	june	from there you have to go to the GRUB page and then scroll down more than I'd like to find out how to install it
2019-01-26 01:30:10	jebrosen	june: It's probably my biggest gripe with the installation guide, since you need to choose a boot loader and boot mode to know what partitions to set up but a first timer might not realize that
2019-01-26 01:30:21	lp	june: lol good point
2019-01-26 01:30:36	lp	it doesn't even list GRUB as first option on that table

2019-01-26 01:31:12	june	jebrosen: I think the guide tries to at least get you to figure out if you booted BIOS or EFI early on now
2019-01-26 01:32:21	jebrosen	june: systemd-boot is another popular choice, but there's no automatic configuration option and it can only chainload other EFI binaries (so usually either /boot = ESP or you have to set up hooks to copy the files yourself)
2019-01-26 01:32:28	lp	it seems this stuff has been updated since I last installed arch on my current system in 2014

2019-01-26 01:34:57	projektir	i had all linuxes freezing on my system

2019-01-26 01:35:14	panicbit	well, there are more updates that I will apply on monday
2019-01-26 01:35:30	projektir	but tbh i should probably jsut get a new laptop
2019-01-26 01:35:31	panicbit	projektir: linux never froze on me, except that one time
2019-01-26 01:35:40	panicbit	where CPU's got stuck
2019-01-26 01:35:47	projektir	thats what my laptop does
2019-01-26 01:35:51	panicbit	and the kernel dutifully reported that
2019-01-26 01:35:52	projektir	panicbit: i had ubuntu freeze on me during install
2019-01-26 01:35:52	projektir	like
2019-01-26 01:35:57	projektir	you choose the lang or w/e
2019-01-26 01:35:59	projektir	and it freezes
2019-01-26 01:36:01	panicbit	and I could just install an lts version
2019-01-26 01:36:06	panicbit	and everything was fine
2019-01-26 01:36:08	projektir	I tried LTS didn't help
2019-01-26 01:36:11	projektir	RIP
2019-01-26 01:36:13	panicbit	goold luck doing that on windows
2019-01-26 01:36:16	panicbit	well
2019-01-26 01:36:19	projektir	Windows just works

2019-01-26 01:36:35	panicbit	if you have ceratin hardware, then you can be massively fucked on windows, I grant you that
2019-01-26 01:36:42	projektir	yes
2019-01-26 01:36:42	panicbit	projektir: especially in your case
2019-01-26 01:36:49	projektir	this hardware is not cooperating with linux
2019-01-26 01:36:52	panicbit	I remember your case being especially fucked up
2019-01-26 01:36:52	projektir	which is too bad
2019-01-26 01:36:57	panicbit	yeah
2019-01-26 01:36:58	projektir	but it does cooperate with video games
2019-01-26 01:36:59	projektir	so w/e
2019-01-26 01:37:12	projektir	i wonder if a virtual machine would work on it o.O
2019-01-26 01:37:17	projektir	or would it freeze, too
2019-01-26 01:37:19	panicbit	this is windows tho
