2019-01-31 05:30:09	_diamondburned_	[[ ]] works in zsh?
2019-01-31 05:30:18	@gwu	since `[` is actually a binary that reads until `]`

2019-01-31 05:57:47	Bear	Personally I’d find one even cheaper with no HDD.
2019-01-31 05:57:54	Bear	Save your money for an SSD.
2019-01-31 05:58:07	Bear	Performance will be light years better with an SSD.

2019-01-31 05:58:41	Bear	X131e is like Chromebook performance.
2019-01-31 05:58:52	xent	oh
2019-01-31 05:58:56	Knar	try and  stick to t or x series
2019-01-31 05:59:00	Bear	It’s not bad.
2019-01-31 05:59:06	Sacul	i'd go with the last one i sent, you can use the ssd as a second drive if you remove the dvd bay
2019-01-31 05:59:14	Bear	But it’s not a true ThinkPad in my opinion.
2019-01-31 05:59:30	Bear	T-series and X-series are what you’re gonna want to stick to.

2019-01-31 06:00:18	Bear	That one doesn’t come with a hard drive.
2019-01-31 06:00:31	Bear	Overall you’re gonna want to get an SSD and 8GBs of RAM.
2019-01-31 06:00:37	Bear	You can survive on less RAM.
2019-01-31 06:00:42	Bear	If you use Linux.
2019-01-31 06:00:46	Sacul	oh it's ok you can get en ssd then

2019-01-31 06:02:46	Bear	Ye, that’s perfect.
2019-01-31 06:02:58	Bear	You can also swap the optical drive for a hard drive caddy.
2019-01-31 06:03:06	Bear	And T430 has an mSATA port.
2019-01-31 06:03:08	Sacul	SSDs are cheaper these days and will keep getting cheaper
2019-01-31 06:03:11	Bear	Cucked to SATA II though.

2019-01-31 13:15:42	_diamondburned_	awk's the slowest

2019-01-31 14:56:34	MarkBeaks	it's a web browser?
2019-01-31 14:56:42	MarkBeaks	interessant
2019-01-31 14:57:35	bfgeshka	w3m is used by some software pieces for rendering pictures in term emulator window
2019-01-31 14:57:41	_diamondburned_	Still bloated
2019-01-31 14:57:46	_diamondburned_	You can't excuse that fact
2019-01-31 14:57:49	MarkBeaks	F
2019-01-31 14:58:13	_diamondburned_	I don't even see how the image quality would be different
2019-01-31 14:58:38	_diamondburned_	Both is using X, it should thus utilize your full X color bit range
2019-01-31 14:58:42	_diamondburned_	same resolution
2019-01-31 14:58:48	_diamondburned_	not sure where the difference is
2019-01-31 14:58:54	MarkBeaks	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2019-01-31 14:58:57	bfgeshka	why would you need pics in term anyway
2019-01-31 14:59:28	_diamondburned_	for file managers
2019-01-31 14:59:42	_diamondburned_	I'm making 6cord but I won't be relying on some dumb hacks for images
2019-01-31 14:59:45	bfgeshka	file managers need to manage files, not show pictures
2019-01-31 14:59:49	_diamondburned_	I'll get sixel
2019-01-31 14:59:59	_diamondburned_	Well great
2019-01-31 15:00:02	_diamondburned_	Nobody cares
2019-01-31 15:00:24	MarkBeaks	what
2019-01-31 15:00:25	_diamondburned_	It's nicer to have images displayed in UI instead of having a pop up window or run external programs
2019-01-31 15:00:28	MarkBeaks	that's stupid
2019-01-31 15:00:30	_diamondburned_	Less overhead when rendering UI
2019-01-31 15:00:34	_diamondburned_	And no
2019-01-31 15:00:36	MarkBeaks	sometimes you need to see images in File Manager
2019-01-31 15:00:38	_diamondburned_	That's wrong too
2019-01-31 15:00:38	MarkBeaks	:v
2019-01-31 15:00:45	_diamondburned_	If all an fm does is manage files
2019-01-31 15:00:49	_diamondburned_	You're better off with cp and mv
2019-01-31 15:01:02	_diamondburned_	There are obvious reasons why people didn't use that
2019-01-31 15:01:12	Plasma	n30f is god teir
2019-01-31 15:01:16	bfgeshka	but people do use cp and mv

2019-01-31 15:02:24	_diamondburned_	Yeah, but that's not what file managers aim for
2019-01-31 15:02:35	bfgeshka	and i personally know people who do not use file managers at all
2019-01-31 15:02:40	_diamondburned_	Just because it manages files doesn't qualify it to be a file manager

2019-02-01 02:32:26	MarkBeaks	ok
2019-02-01 02:32:30	DewWisp	How about the fact that you can define functions in JavaScript like this?
2019-02-01 02:32:41	MarkBeaks	nadekobot?
2019-02-01 02:32:44	MarkBeaks	was zum teufel
2019-02-01 02:32:49	DewWisp	```JavaScript
2019-02-01 02:32:49	DewWisp	var function = new Function("arg_1", "arg_2", "return arg_1 + arg_2");

2019-02-01 02:33:19	MarkBeaks	fucking horrible
2019-02-01 02:33:23	MarkBeaks	i think
2019-02-01 02:33:28	Bear	That's not how you do them.
2019-02-01 02:33:33	Bear	Anyone that does is a brainlet.

2019-02-01 02:33:41	DewWisp	I'm just saying you can
2019-02-01 02:34:03	Jake_Moon	How you do it = GNU god looking upon you
2019-02-01 02:34:12	DewWisp	It's actually useful because you can dynamically define functions via template strings using this (or so I've heard)
2019-02-01 02:34:13	ym555	o/
2019-02-01 02:34:16	Bear	But JS has many weird quirks.

2019-02-01 04:34:12	Renzix	they all have examples
2019-02-01 04:34:15	Bear	Used to use teknik.io.

2019-02-01 07:08:50	_diamondburned_	They both use vte
2019-02-01 07:08:54	_diamondburned_	Get yeeted
2019-02-01 07:09:16	_diamondburned_	I also wrote a xresources to lxterm conf at one point
2019-02-01 07:09:20	Renzix	So does a buncha other terminals
2019-02-01 07:09:36	_diamondburned_	lxt is light tho
2019-02-01 07:10:14	Renzix	I would argue but I don't even know and I'm on phone
2019-02-01 07:10:35	_diamondburned_	so succless it doesn't even use transparency
2019-02-01 07:10:49	_diamondburned_	wow gboard has succless in its dictionary
2019-02-01 07:10:49	Renzix	Yea there's a patch for it
2019-02-01 07:10:52	tA	> succless
2019-02-01 07:10:52	tA	 
2019-02-01 07:10:52	tA	more like suck more amiright?
2019-02-01 07:10:57	tA	i dont know the memes in here

2019-02-01 07:11:38	tdeo	termite is honestly better when it doesn't take 400ms to fucking open
2019-02-01 07:11:50	tdeo	i will open it in a frame and switch to another one before it opens
2019-02-01 07:11:54	tdeo	messes everything up
2019-02-01 07:11:54	_diamondburned_	What's in termite anw
2019-02-01 07:12:05	tdeo	it's a vte term with a config file and some meme keyboard stuff
2019-02-01 07:12:05	_diamondburned_	tilix is better without the graphical glitches
2019-02-01 07:12:19	tdeo	you can select text and click urls keyboard only in termite
2019-02-01 07:12:28	_diamondburned_	EDIT: tilix is better without the UX glitches
2019-02-01 07:12:53	_diamondburned_	keyboard only meme
2019-02-01 07:12:56	Renzix	It's supposed to be a vi like terminal emulator
2019-02-01 07:13:40	Renzix	By default it's also decent which is a big reason why people use it
2019-02-01 07:13:59	tdeo	yeah that's mostly why
2019-02-01 07:14:05	_diamondburned_	by default anything vte is decent tbh
2019-02-01 07:14:12	tdeo	it has a config file though
2019-02-01 07:14:18	_diamondburned_	so does lxt
2019-02-01 07:14:20	tdeo	ah
2019-02-01 07:14:26	tdeo	it's not part of a DE
2019-02-01 07:14:31	_diamondburned_	lul
2019-02-01 07:14:44	_diamondburned_	>implying lxde qualifies as one
2019-02-01 07:14:55	tdeo	i mean it does
2019-02-01 07:15:00	ym555	oh hey i got the spoiler etag
2019-02-01 07:15:03	tdeo	just because they didn't write their own wm doesn't mean otherwise
2019-02-01 07:15:08	tdeo	yoeah it's fully rolled out now
2019-02-01 07:15:09	ym555	i just had to reload the page x)

2019-02-01 07:15:26	_diamondburned_	They borrow a lot of stuff from different places while missing features
2019-02-01 07:15:29	ym555	@Renzix yea
2019-02-01 07:15:34	ym555	also that test is bad
2019-02-01 07:15:36	_diamondburned_	But it's aimed at that
2019-02-01 07:15:36	Renzix	Wrong
2019-02-01 07:15:38	_diamondburned_	so yeah
2019-02-01 07:15:48	ym555	since i'd see that if i didn't have the spoiler tag
2019-02-01 07:15:49	Renzix	If you did you wouldn't of known I said that
2019-02-01 07:15:50	tdeo	i've never actually used it for more than a few minutes so dunno
2019-02-01 07:15:53	ym555	it wouldn't be magically hidden
2019-02-01 07:15:54	_diamondburned_	lyl
2019-02-01 07:16:01	_diamondburned_	I had that as my main for a year
2019-02-01 07:16:12	_diamondburned_	My rc.xml actually derived from lxde's
2019-02-01 07:16:22	@gwu	tA: there's no way of not making it use `~/.ghcup` and so on, right?
2019-02-01 07:16:24	Renzix	Smart person would've said I can't see what your typing cuz it's in a spoiler
2019-02-01 07:16:39	_diamondburned_	@ym555 use the CSS tbh
2019-02-01 07:16:45	ym555	i'm too lazy
2019-02-01 07:16:46	_diamondburned_	Unspoil it
2019-02-01 07:16:46	tA	@grimm I have no idea what that is
2019-02-01 07:16:59	ym555	tf is ghcup 🤔
2019-02-01 07:17:00	@gwu	tA: i'm installing haskell manually
2019-02-01 07:17:03	ym555	it uses .ghci/

2019-02-01 07:17:27	ym555	just install stack
2019-02-01 07:17:29	@gwu	no
2019-02-01 07:17:36	ym555	or nix
2019-02-01 07:17:37	ym555	or guix
2019-02-01 07:17:37	Renzix	Whenever you see painless
2019-02-01 07:17:38	_diamondburned_	get fucked
2019-02-01 07:17:40	ym555	use those if you want haskell
2019-02-01 07:17:40	_diamondburned_	>no
2019-02-01 07:17:44	Renzix	You know it's gonna be painful
2019-02-01 07:17:45	_diamondburned_	>**no**
2019-02-01 07:17:47	ym555	and cabal alone works too
2019-02-01 07:17:50	_diamondburned_	no
2019-02-01 07:17:51	@gwu	stack gives me ncurses bugs
2019-02-01 07:17:51	tA	nix, stack are your only real options
2019-02-01 07:17:55	_diamondburned_	no
2019-02-01 07:17:56	tA	cabal is alright
2019-02-01 07:17:59	tA	nix is the best
2019-02-01 07:18:02	ym555	stack uses cabal no?
2019-02-01 07:18:02	_diamondburned_	no
2019-02-01 07:18:11	ym555	and nix also uses cabal, although you can do without it
2019-02-01 07:18:29	ym555	@grimm what ncurses bug 🤔
2019-02-01 07:18:36	_diamondburned_	no
2019-02-01 07:18:38	tdeo	oh, nix is in the gentoo repos

2019-02-01 07:19:09	tdeo	yes @ym555
2019-02-01 07:19:13	tdeo	it's also in the nix repos

2019-02-01 07:19:38	tdeo	apt is in the nix repos too
2019-02-01 07:19:41	_diamondburned_	It doesn't
2019-02-01 07:19:56	@gwu	ym555: haskell uses ncurses 5 or some shit
2019-02-01 07:20:06	ym555	is that an old ver or a new ver?
2019-02-01 07:20:08	@gwu	and 6 has been out for a **while**
2019-02-01 07:20:12	ym555	o
2019-02-01 07:20:13	_diamondburned_	Why would a toolset need ncurses
2019-02-01 07:20:15	ym555	well why do you care
2019-02-01 07:20:16	_diamondburned_	What in the what
2019-02-01 07:20:32	ym555	can't you just install ncurses 5 🤔
2019-02-01 07:20:34	Renzix	Repl prob
2019-02-01 07:20:35	tA	nix isnt a package manager, its a way of life for people who dont get dates
2019-02-01 07:20:36	ym555	along with 7
2019-02-01 07:20:45	_diamondburned_	Can't you just not have nc
2019-02-01 07:20:47	@gwu	ym555: because it doesn't work on gentoo or void or arch
2019-02-01 07:20:47	ym555	>nix isnt a package manager, its a way of life for people who dont get dates
2019-02-01 07:20:47	ym555	ik

2019-02-01 07:21:02	ym555	interesting
2019-02-01 07:21:06	Renzix	Linux isn't a operating system it's a time waster
2019-02-01 07:21:17	_diamondburned_	I still have no idea why a toolset would need nc
2019-02-01 07:21:20	_diamondburned_	But alright
2019-02-01 07:21:22	ym555	repl
2019-02-01 07:21:23	tA	neither tbh

2019-02-01 07:21:30	ym555	wait no 🤔
2019-02-01 07:21:30	_diamondburned_	What's repl
2019-02-01 07:21:36	tdeo	why the fuck is this so hard to get working
2019-02-01 07:21:36	ym555	repl should use readline
2019-02-01 07:21:38	tA	read evaluate print loop
2019-02-01 07:21:40	tdeo	i just want a read only prefix
2019-02-01 07:21:41	tdeo	aaaaaa
2019-02-01 07:21:43	ym555	not ncurses

2019-02-01 07:21:48	ym555	maybe readline depends on ncurses
2019-02-01 07:21:54	@gwu	EMERGE YOU BETTER FUCKING DO THIS RIGHT OR I'LL USE  ADISTRO WITH SYSTEMD YOU LITTLE BITCH
2019-02-01 07:21:55	Renzix	Repl can still use ncurses and stuff
2019-02-01 07:21:55	_diamondburned_	Wtf
2019-02-01 07:21:57	ym555	but why would it depend on old version
2019-02-01 07:22:00	ym555	>Repl can still use ncurses and stuff
2019-02-01 07:22:00	ym555	not relaly

2019-02-01 07:22:02	ym555	not really
2019-02-01 07:22:07	_diamondburned_	That would be the ultimate bloat
2019-02-01 07:22:08	ym555	it is useless
2019-02-01 07:22:28	_diamondburned_	I don't think rl depends on nc
2019-02-01 07:22:46	Renzix	It doesn't but Haskell may use both
2019-02-01 07:23:05	_diamondburned_	I wouldn't say it but
2019-02-01 07:23:10	_diamondburned_	That's bloat, mate
2019-02-01 07:23:19	@gwu	if `sudo emerge haskell-platform` fails
2019-02-01 07:23:21	@gwu	...
2019-02-01 07:23:32	Renzix	Prob is but it's one of the standard ways to install Haskell so yea
2019-02-01 07:23:38	tA	> not using `nix-build project.nix`
2019-02-01 07:23:41	ym555	@grimm don't use haskell-platform
2019-02-01 07:23:56	@gwu	HOLY SHIT
2019-02-01 07:24:17	Renzix	Lemme guess it failed
2019-02-01 07:24:26	@gwu	https://ptpb.pw/ja-1.png that's a lot of stuff...

2019-02-01 07:24:35	ym555	🤔
2019-02-01 07:24:40	ym555	problem with that lib apparently
2019-02-01 07:24:43	ym555	whicih is in ncurses
2019-02-01 07:24:44	Renzix	Yea Haskell has alot of stuff
2019-02-01 07:24:47	@gwu	oh yeah
2019-02-01 07:24:58	@gwu	that's why ghcup didn't work
2019-02-01 07:25:09	tA	haskell trades off disk space in return for being a not-shit language
2019-02-01 07:25:26	ym555	yeah it is just a good language with a mess of an ecosystem
2019-02-01 07:25:30	tA	^^
2019-02-01 07:25:45	tA	if you want a good language with a not-mess of an ecosystem just use Hoon

2019-02-01 09:16:49	Navonod	mistakes were made
2019-02-01 09:17:12	Navonod	I had nothing to do so I got wsl set up with i3 and got it all working consistently
2019-02-01 09:18:02	ym555	big mistake
2019-02-01 09:18:06	Navonod	As a side note, I've learned that wpg works on WSLtty
2019-02-01 09:18:32	ym555	cute wp btw
2019-02-01 09:18:32	Navonod	So the same colors my st uses will carry over to my other

2019-02-01 09:18:55	@gwu	you did what i didn't want to
2019-02-01 09:19:03	@gwu	damn
2019-02-01 09:20:33	Navonod	this shit was actual aids to setup
2019-02-01 09:20:43	Navonod	But now it is super nice and I don't have to touch it
2019-02-01 09:21:40	Navonod	I've been in windows a ton because gaming , so figured I would fill the hole a little.
2019-02-01 09:22:26	Navonod	And in case I need to do some quick edits or coding, it's all here.
2019-02-01 09:23:00	davidv7	Are you defending wsl?
2019-02-01 09:23:38	Navonod	hell no
2019-02-01 09:23:45	Navonod	wsl is shit
2019-02-01 09:23:58	OTheB	^
2019-02-01 09:24:08	Navonod	But, it's better than powershell. And it's better than using literally anything just plain windows.
2019-02-01 09:24:16	OTheB	I solve my *nix woes at wok with an Arch VM
2019-02-01 09:24:20	OTheB	EDIT: I solve my *nix woes at work with an Arch VM
2019-02-01 09:24:49	Navonod	You see, I like VM, but I am not sure how shared folder performance comes into play. TBF though, WSL has really bad performance in the long run
2019-02-01 09:25:34	OTheB	Even hooked it up to the work vcs server so I can theoretically do full dev shit in it... that is, once *anything* is .NET Core rather than Framework
2019-02-01 09:25:59	Navonod	took me around an hour to install the asciidoc
2019-02-01 09:26:01	Navonod	😬

2019-02-01 09:46:31	@gwu	yeah
2019-02-01 09:46:32	@gwu	no
2019-02-01 09:46:38	@gwu	not spending 10$
2019-02-01 09:47:01	Navonod	Now, to get this looking all nice without having a floating wsl terminal, first I made a batch script that runs ubuntu1804, changes my directory, sources my profile, and runs stuff
2019-02-01 09:47:11	Navonod	but if I run that batch, it still opens a terminal
2019-02-01 09:47:18	Navonod	so I wrap that in a vb script

2019-02-01 09:47:36	Navonod	and then I just add to the batch to have it start vcxsrv locked to my second monitor only
2019-02-01 09:48:02	Navonod	throw that in my start menu with a fancy shortcut. Throw it in my startup. Never touch it again
2019-02-01 09:48:04	@gwu	so if i made a wrapper for qmemu that'd be even better?
2019-02-01 09:48:12	Navonod	Hand wavy black magic is gone.

2019-02-01 09:49:07	@gwu	dinner first though
2019-02-01 09:49:07	Navonod	Just run virtualbox in fullscreen
2019-02-01 09:49:16	Navonod	this was testing if I could

2019-02-01 09:56:39	Navonod	That's something I've been asking for for at least 3 years now
2019-02-01 09:56:41	Zed_	that's very important functionality
2019-02-01 09:56:52	Navonod	Nevermind server folders
2019-02-01 09:57:00	Zed_	up to this point I had to describe vital info for shows by replacing them with [REDACTED]

2019-02-01 20:19:38	ym555	because website gay
2019-02-01 20:19:50	ym555	and a cli can give you a lot more power

2019-02-01 20:21:41	ym555	but that can be fixed by plugins i guess

2019-02-01 20:23:05	ym555	i mean no gui is going to implement those anyway
2019-02-01 20:23:24	ym555	so a cli is more convenient because it forces you to use keyboard shortcuts every where

2019-02-01 20:26:03	ym555	tui is ncurses
2019-02-01 20:26:20	bfgeshka	you will see good keyboard-oriented interfaces when your mouse will suddenly break and you'll just have to browse with keyboard only

2019-02-01 20:27:58	davidv7	Ok retard someone above said its the same thing
2019-02-01 20:28:20	bfgeshka	cli is not tui, obviously
2019-02-01 20:28:29	viz	The problem with guis is that they are clunky and complicated

2019-02-01 20:30:16	OTheB	Well we can all agree on one thing: WUIs were a mistake
2019-02-01 20:30:21	bfgeshka	btw, cli has no keybindings, moron
2019-02-01 20:30:23	ym555	tf is a wui 🤔
2019-02-01 20:30:28	OTheB	Web UI
2019-02-01 20:30:31	OTheB	a la Discord
2019-02-01 20:30:38	ym555	that's just flat design
2019-02-01 20:30:53	OTheB	No, as in a UI that's a web page
2019-02-01 20:31:00	viz	It's some colors which look crappy most of the time
2019-02-01 20:31:02	OTheB	a **Web UI**
2019-02-01 20:31:13	ym555	🤔
2019-02-01 20:31:19	ym555	how is that different from a graphical ui
2019-02-01 20:31:27	viz	It's in html and css
2019-02-01 20:31:28	OTheB	A GUI isn't a web page
2019-02-01 20:31:32	viz	And it's in the web
2019-02-01 20:31:36	OTheB	It's an application on your computer
2019-02-01 20:31:46	ym555	i mean sure, but a web page is a graphical interface
2019-02-01 20:31:57	OTheB	A WUI is a webpage
2019-02-01 20:32:02	bfgeshka	web page is a document, technically
2019-02-01 20:32:02	ym555	okay
2019-02-01 20:32:08	viz	What if I visit the page in a terminal browser lmao
2019-02-01 20:32:10	ym555	what does that distinction lead to
2019-02-01 20:32:11	_diamondburned_	Web UI is counted as GUI
2019-02-01 20:32:20	_diamondburned_	GUI doesn't have to be a Native application
2019-02-01 20:32:20	OTheB	^
2019-02-01 20:32:25	ym555	you have made a useless distinction
2019-02-01 20:32:37	OTheB	Except it's not useless
2019-02-01 20:32:39	viz	Both are shitty anw
2019-02-01 20:32:43	ym555	sure a webui is gui on the web, but what's the differente between that and a normal gui

2019-02-01 20:34:00	OTheB	But a WUI **is a webpage** where a GUI you're contrasting it to **isn't a webpage**
2019-02-01 20:34:11	_diamondburned_	Due to how websites are rendered it's not as snappy
2019-02-01 20:34:12	ym555	yes why is that distinction useful
2019-02-01 20:34:25	bfgeshka	why these things have to be expleined though
2019-02-01 20:34:25	OTheB	So you can know before you try and use something if you should even bother
2019-02-01 20:34:38	ym555	w0t
2019-02-01 20:34:54	OTheB	Like, if something says "Web UI" I'll nope out immediately

2019-02-01 20:36:39	@gwu	websites shouldn't be anything but static

2019-02-01 20:37:49	lidl_papi	@steamport yes
2019-02-01 20:37:54	OTheB	Ok, but if you make a WUI that uses 200MiB for some stupid simple shit, then you've made a shit WUI
2019-02-01 20:38:00	OTheB	So you can't make a good WUI
2019-02-01 20:38:11	bfgeshka	at least GUIs can be made not as retardedas a webpage ui
2019-02-01 20:38:12	ym555	"a good gui" in "normal" sense is something that shows you all the information you need, and allows access to any other information in a fast way (and for my, that is using the keyboard)
2019-02-01 20:38:18	OTheB	It's a fundamentally shit platform to build a UI on
2019-02-01 20:38:21	ym555	you don't count resources into shit like that
2019-02-01 20:38:23	@gwu	the way it is right now, makes javascript,etc a huge hack to get around the design flaws of html/css

2019-02-01 20:38:30	steamport	Because once again, Rust compiles on nearly everything
2019-02-01 20:38:35	_diamondburned_	What if my WebUI doesn't use that much and is responsive though
2019-02-01 20:38:41	ym555	^
2019-02-01 20:38:44	ym555	like lmao
2019-02-01 20:38:45	_diamondburned_	I did it before
2019-02-01 20:38:51	_diamondburned_	I can totally do it again
2019-02-01 20:38:51	ym555	you can make stuff that doesn't use a shitton of resources
2019-02-01 20:39:05	bfgeshka	you webui uses browser as a base
2019-02-01 20:39:07	ym555	it will use more resources than a traditional ui
2019-02-01 20:39:08	_diamondburned_	If you don't count loading image as resources, mine barely uses 10
2019-02-01 20:39:14	@gwu	what if your webui needs all sorts of frameworks (this includes browsers) to work?
2019-02-01 20:39:21	_diamondburned_	It doesn't
2019-02-01 20:39:26	lidl_papi	what if it's flutter
2019-02-01 20:39:28	@gwu	it needs shitter
2019-02-01 20:39:32	_diamondburned_	and?
2019-02-01 20:39:33	ym555	EDIT: it will use more resources than a traditional ui, but it take 200mb ram
2019-02-01 20:39:34	@gwu	xD
2019-02-01 20:39:39	_diamondburned_	Sciter isn't web ui
2019-02-01 20:39:42	ym555	tldr that distinction is useless
2019-02-01 20:39:42	bfgeshka	"i don't care"
2019-02-01 20:39:45	_diamondburned_	I'm not talking about that
2019-02-01 20:39:51	_diamondburned_	Sciter renders natively
2019-02-01 20:39:55	@gwu	it still takes more than a normal qt or gtk gui
2019-02-01 20:39:58	_diamondburned_	It just uses HTML for its markup
2019-02-01 20:40:04	_diamondburned_	Qt takes less
2019-02-01 20:40:06	_diamondburned_	Mind you
2019-02-01 20:40:15	@gwu	yeah, it does
2019-02-01 20:40:22	yemou	peen
2019-02-01 20:40:25	@gwu	it uses less resources
2019-02-01 20:40:29	ym555	pee
2019-02-01 20:40:30	_diamondburned_	If you actually know how to use QtQuick, it's easy

2019-02-01 20:42:13	bfgeshka	it's not about a belief, you are using bloatware as a required base for your UI, you just cannot wave your way around with imaginary benchmarks about it

2019-02-01 20:43:06	viz	It burns my eyes a lil bit

2019-02-01 20:44:56	_diamondburned_	yes you tard
2019-02-01 20:44:59	_diamondburned_	It uses fb
2019-02-01 20:45:00	@gwu	_diamondburned_: i know you're going to say you don't care, but the fact that you're promoting something so innately broken is a bit shit...
2019-02-01 20:45:04	ym555	does w3m even work in tty
2019-02-01 20:45:11	@gwu	yeah it does

2019-02-01 20:45:16	ym555	that's neat
2019-02-01 20:45:17	@gwu	it even displays images

2019-02-01 20:45:47	_diamondburned_	I don't care what you think
2019-02-01 20:45:47	lidl_papi	making native guis just to satisfy 0.5% of users is retarded tbqh
2019-02-01 20:45:59	bfgeshka	i don't care if you care or not
2019-02-01 20:45:59	_diamondburned_	Aww you said a fact :(

2019-02-01 20:50:52	ym555	they aren't like guilds in discord
2019-02-01 20:51:05	_diamondburned_	Maybe Bancho has other weird shit then
2019-02-01 20:51:08	ym555	like freenode server has a #bspwm channel #linux and whatever channel

2019-02-02 01:29:29	viz	🔪
2019-02-02 01:29:37	Bear	He’s tryna be number one.
2019-02-02 01:29:39	Sacul	They're taking ages to load
2019-02-02 01:29:42	davidv7	>terribly unoptimized
2019-02-02 01:29:42	davidv7	double negative?
2019-02-02 01:29:50	Bear	It’s OK to sleep ym
2019-02-02 01:29:55	Bear	I will reclaim my spot.
2019-02-02 01:30:00	Sacul	No, I mean they are not optimized at all
2019-02-02 01:30:02	Bear	YEEHAW.
2019-02-02 01:30:05	ym555	unity == easy to create games
2019-02-02 01:30:05	ym555	easy to create games == beginners use
2019-02-02 01:30:05	ym555	beginners use == bad optimization
2019-02-02 01:30:17	davidv7	ym cracked it
2019-02-02 01:30:17	davidv7	what a god
2019-02-02 01:30:18	davidv7	also
2019-02-02 01:30:20	davidv7	why am i not top5
2019-02-02 01:30:21	davidv7	this month
2019-02-02 01:30:22	Sacul	Like my computer froze when I was moving to another level

2019-02-02 01:30:44	Sacul	Checked out of the game and it was eating all of my ram and swap lol
2019-02-02 01:30:44	_diamondburned_	go == easy lang

2019-02-02 01:30:44	_diamondburned_	attracts js idiots == shit ecosystem
2019-02-02 01:30:45	lidl_papi	c = easy syntax

2019-02-02 01:31:05	ym555	c isn't easy though
2019-02-02 01:31:09	ym555	well it is
2019-02-02 01:31:15	ym555	and it isn't at the same time

2019-02-02 01:31:19	_diamondburned_	it is until it isn't
2019-02-02 01:31:25	lidl_papi	@_diamondburned_ there is always rust if it gets too bad
2019-02-02 01:31:27	Sacul	Now that I moved into another are it apparently has not freed the previous one from memory lmao
2019-02-02 01:31:30	ym555	its syntax is piss easy and familiar to everyone
2019-02-02 01:31:33	_diamondburned_	there's also death
2019-02-02 01:31:35	davidv7	so what, do you think C programs can't be unoptimized?
2019-02-02 01:31:35	davidv7	lol
2019-02-02 01:31:39	_diamondburned_	which is a preferable choice over rust
2019-02-02 01:31:47	_diamondburned_	ngl i'd rather learn fucking c++
2019-02-02 01:31:57	lidl_papi	they're bloating rust so if you don't wanna be left behind, start learning now
2019-02-02 01:31:59	_diamondburned_	more jobs, less cancerous syntax *imho*
2019-02-02 01:32:00	ym555	@davidv7 they're easiest to be "unoptimized" lmao
2019-02-02 01:32:03	lidl_papi	2018 rust has so many new features
2019-02-02 01:32:08	_diamondburned_	rust is already bloated for me
2019-02-02 01:32:25	Sacul	And when I accidently came back the the previous area, it did free the one I just was in Wtf
2019-02-02 01:32:31	davidv7	@ym555 exactly, all C does is provide a better programmer, to optimize it more than he'd be able to with other langs
2019-02-02 01:32:37	Sacul	EDIT: And when I accidently came back to the previous area, it did free the one I just was in Wtf
2019-02-02 01:32:49	ym555	yes but c crushes begineers
2019-02-02 01:32:53	Sacul	^
2019-02-02 01:33:06	viz	use rust instead 😉
2019-02-02 01:33:09	lidl_papi	only if they come from js or C#
2019-02-02 01:33:11	viz	handles most crap itself :P
2019-02-02 01:33:12	davidv7	does it?
2019-02-02 01:33:14	_diamondburned_	what I said earlier
2019-02-02 01:33:16	ym555	you have to know what you're doing to not have ub and segfault
2019-02-02 01:33:16	_diamondburned_	Maybe I'll do C
2019-02-02 01:33:17	ym555	yes
2019-02-02 01:33:18	davidv7	i dont think it does with actual beginners lol
2019-02-02 01:33:22	ym555	you can leaks tons of memory easily
2019-02-02 01:33:22	_diamondburned_	Gtk shit has C
2019-02-02 01:33:30	davidv7	if you're coming from a comfier lang then sure
2019-02-02 01:33:31	ym555	and ub is so easily to do
2019-02-02 01:33:34	_diamondburned_	Go does most of what I want but Gtk sucks there
2019-02-02 01:33:34	ym555	even experienced programmers do it
2019-02-02 01:33:41	Sacul	What's with with this crappy game using almost 6GB of ram
2019-02-02 01:33:50	viz	I really fucking hate the new rust site

2019-02-02 01:34:06	ym555	wdym actual beginners 🤔
2019-02-02 01:34:13	davidv7	its pretty
2019-02-02 01:34:28	ym555	like people who don't know how to program at all?
2019-02-02 01:34:29	_diamondburned_	I really fucking hate the new rust
2019-02-02 01:34:30	davidv7	@ym555 someone that is new to C but did python/js vs someone that never wrote a line of code
2019-02-02 01:34:33	_diamondburned_	Future? What a joke
2019-02-02 01:34:37	ym555	ah
2019-02-02 01:35:02	_diamondburned_	A Promise like System is exactly why I hate js
2019-02-02 01:35:16	_diamondburned_	well, for the most part
2019-02-02 01:35:42	ym555	idk people who never programmed at all seem to have a "barrier" that they need to cross to actually start programming, that barrier is actually thinking about your code and how the language works
2019-02-02 01:35:55	ym555	so  c would put even more load on them
2019-02-02 01:35:55	_diamondburned_	not in js
2019-02-02 01:36:07	_diamondburned_	in js, it's about not thinking
2019-02-02 01:36:18	_diamondburned_	Usually your code would have an order
2019-02-02 01:36:22	_diamondburned_	Well, welcome to JS
2019-02-02 01:36:27	lidl_papi	async/await is nice
2019-02-02 01:37:02	davidv7	@ym555 depends what you're making... the electrical engineers here mostly only learn C
2019-02-02 01:37:05	_diamondburned_	It's dog shit imo
2019-02-02 01:37:10	_diamondburned_	everything is chaotic and there is no order
2019-02-02 01:37:14	davidv7	and they suck at it unless they take voluntary courses
2019-02-02 01:37:16	_diamondburned_	hard to maintain and debug
2019-02-02 01:37:28	<--	fr3fou (fr3fou@discord) has quit (Leaving...)
2019-02-02 01:37:48	_diamondburned_	I'd imagine C being a light and fast language when compiled, so it's used in IoT stuff
2019-02-02 01:37:55	ym555	they don't make any large programs though right? you won't really have dynamic allocation and have to mess with stuff like pointers rarely?
2019-02-02 01:37:56	_diamondburned_	has a small footprint, pretty low level
2019-02-02 01:37:59	ym555	(idk the field)
2019-02-02 01:38:03	ym555	so maybe i'm wrong
2019-02-02 01:38:06	davidv7	@ym555 yeah exactly
2019-02-02 01:38:14	lidl_papi	i just want money tbqh
2019-02-02 01:38:19	_diamondburned_	>rust
2019-02-02 01:38:20	_diamondburned_	Yeah wow
2019-02-02 01:38:24	_diamondburned_	Contradictory
2019-02-02 01:38:34	davidv7	they dont get to embedded until they take voluntary courses
2019-02-02 01:38:41	davidv7	thats when they usually get better at it
2019-02-02 01:38:52	davidv7	but none of my friends took any of those, they're just stuck doing math lmao
2019-02-02 01:38:57	davidv7	and circuit logic
2019-02-02 01:39:27	ym555	o
2019-02-02 01:39:30	_diamondburned_	||
2019-02-02 01:39:30	_diamondburned_	I wonder 
2019-02-02 01:39:30	_diamondburned_	||
2019-02-02 01:39:49	_diamondburned_	just give them time

2019-02-02 01:39:59	_diamondburned_	They'll make an asm capable circuitry
2019-02-02 01:40:30	davidv7	some will, usually they get classic engineering jobs
2019-02-02 01:40:45	_diamondburned_	tbh if I ever go to a uc
2019-02-02 01:40:48	davidv7	which still arent all coding i think
2019-02-02 01:40:51	_diamondburned_	I'll develop RISC v
2019-02-02 01:40:56	_diamondburned_	EDIT: I'll develop RISC-V
2019-02-02 01:40:58	davidv7	what's UC
2019-02-02 01:41:10	ym555	^
2019-02-02 01:41:17	_diamondburned_	University of California
2019-02-02 01:41:20	_diamondburned_	the good ones
2019-02-02 01:41:25	_diamondburned_	Those are hard as fuck to get in
2019-02-02 01:41:57	davidv7	oh i only know of like Harvard,Yale and MIT
2019-02-02 01:42:11	_diamondburned_	Cliche ones
2019-02-02 01:42:12	davidv7	but it feels like someone mentions a new "very good school" every week lol
2019-02-02 01:42:22	davidv7	so i stopped paying attention
2019-02-02 01:42:25	_diamondburned_	UCs are there for decades mate
2019-02-02 01:42:39	ym555	>Those are hard as fuck to get in
2019-02-02 01:42:39	ym555	those are the ones with a hard curriculum  right? 😛
2019-02-02 01:42:39	_diamondburned_	One of the UC directly developed RISC-V
2019-02-02 01:42:49	davidv7	yeah berkley
2019-02-02 01:42:52	_diamondburned_	Hard curriculum and high requirements
2019-02-02 01:42:57	_diamondburned_	Yeah Berkeley
2019-02-02 01:43:00	davidv7	EDIT: yeah berkeley
2019-02-02 01:43:09	_diamondburned_	I want to go to UC Davis tho
2019-02-02 01:43:10	davidv7	thats another one i've heard of i didnt know it was in Cali tho
2019-02-02 01:43:15	_diamondburned_	They have an Ubuntu repo
2019-02-02 01:43:17	ym555	i'd love to see diamond struggling with cs courses :^)
2019-02-02 01:43:22	_diamondburned_	ok retarded
2019-02-02 01:43:24	davidv7	lol
2019-02-02 01:43:31	_diamondburned_	I'll be forced to learn Java tbh
2019-02-02 01:43:37	_diamondburned_	force brainwash
2019-02-02 01:43:44	davidv7	well you definitely wouldnt be doing go
2019-02-02 01:43:45	davidv7	lol
2019-02-02 01:43:50	davidv7	at least not at the start
2019-02-02 01:43:51	_diamondburned_	yeah
2019-02-02 01:43:51	ym555	yea you will
2019-02-02 01:43:57	davidv7	C/C++/java
2019-02-02 01:43:57	_diamondburned_	I'll be doing Go for jobs tho
2019-02-02 01:44:00	_diamondburned_	That's for sure

2019-02-02 01:44:14	ym555	and some python too
2019-02-02 01:44:14	_diamondburned_	I'll try and apply for a Google internship
2019-02-02 01:44:16	_diamondburned_	Definitely
2019-02-02 01:44:19	ym555	all the languages you love
2019-02-02 01:44:23	_diamondburned_	I already did Pytho
2019-02-02 01:44:25	_diamondburned_	fuck you
2019-02-02 01:44:30	_diamondburned_	That's the first language I ever did
2019-02-02 01:44:41	ym555	you'll have to do it again
2019-02-02 01:44:44	davidv7	if USA does CS the way schools here do, they'll let you pick languages, but i feel like its pretty hard to do data structures type stuff without pointers
2019-02-02 01:44:52	_diamondburned_	Pick what tho
2019-02-02 01:44:52	davidv7	and they wont let you use libraries
2019-02-02 01:44:58	_diamondburned_	All choices are prob crap
2019-02-02 01:45:00	ym555	data structures are the easiest
2019-02-02 01:45:34	ym555	algorithms are hard, not to implement (or understand most of the time) but to come up with
2019-02-02 01:45:58	_diamondburned_	I just use libraries hue
2019-02-02 01:46:01	ym555	i'm bad at that stuff :GWczeAngryCry: <https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/402867151465086981.png>
2019-02-02 01:46:05	_diamondburned_	Same
2019-02-02 01:46:14	davidv7	well usually you'd choose between:
2019-02-02 01:46:14	davidv7	-> stuff the staff knows so they'd be able to help or something
2019-02-02 01:46:14	davidv7	-> stuff you know well and are confident could do the job
2019-02-02 01:46:31	davidv7	most CS students here dont know hot to program well enough to know a lang well enough
2019-02-02 01:46:39	ym555	>I just use libraries hue
2019-02-02 01:46:39	ym555	that's why you learn nothing :^)
2019-02-02 01:46:40	davidv7	when they start out
2019-02-02 01:46:46	davidv7	and the staff here is mostly for C, C++ and Java
2019-02-02 01:47:03	ym555	idk i don't think i need help, the internet should be good enough
2019-02-02 01:47:09	davidv7	@ym555 coming up with algorithms in what context? just randomly thinking of something sounds very unlikely
2019-02-02 01:47:16	davidv7	otherwise its just you knowing the problem really well
2019-02-02 01:47:22	davidv7	and solving it step by step
2019-02-02 01:47:39	davidv7	and it almost always exists already
2019-02-02 01:48:17	davidv7	example: think of a search and replace algorithm
2019-02-02 01:48:17	davidv7	oh you spent 4 weeks on it? a math person solved it with half the time complexity and a quarter of space complexity with 1/4 of LOC
2019-02-02 01:48:26	davidv7	and he solved it 30 years ago
2019-02-02 01:48:44	lidl_papi	i wanna be a suckless chad developer
2019-02-02 01:49:03	lidl_papi	i will become a project manager and force programmers to write suckless software

2019-02-02 01:49:14	ym555	like you have problem x and you want solution for it, i'm bad at that
2019-02-02 01:49:27	ym555	i think i get stuck on one way to do it, and try to make it work without exploring other stuff

2019-02-02 01:49:46	ym555	and when i try to explore other solutions my brain just ugh breaks
2019-02-02 01:50:09	davidv7	oh yeah i definitely have a problem of seeing it one way instantly
2019-02-02 01:50:13	ym555	maybe practice will help idk
2019-02-02 01:50:14	davidv7	and then just getting stuck in that one way
2019-02-02 01:50:14	davidv7	lol
2019-02-02 01:50:33	ym555	i don't do any programming challenges or problems so maybe that's the problem
2019-02-02 01:50:48	ym555	and i tend to give up too easily too
2019-02-02 01:51:02	ym555	i should fix that...
2019-02-02 01:51:08	davidv7	i mean its probably easy to give up
2019-02-02 01:51:13	davidv7	because almost everything has been solved
2019-02-02 01:51:14	davidv7	lol
2019-02-02 01:51:34	davidv7	easier to google an algorithm than it is to spend weeks coming up with it then optimizing it
2019-02-02 01:52:05	ym555	but you know i think you gain something by solving it yourself
2019-02-02 01:52:11	davidv7	yeah, for sure
2019-02-02 01:52:37	davidv7	but i think if you wanna work on algorithms, try to solve math type problems
2019-02-02 01:52:44	ym555	gotta stop procrastinating and work on my flawsi guess

2019-02-02 03:46:33	_diamondburned_	Don't tell me
2019-02-02 03:46:38	_diamondburned_	Don't tell me
2019-02-02 03:46:47	_diamondburned_	They got the real Wayland on their official drivers?
2019-02-02 03:46:54	ahrs	No
2019-02-02 03:46:59	ahrs	They ported kwin thoug
2019-02-02 03:46:59	_diamondburned_	oh
2019-02-02 03:47:02	ahrs	EDIT: They ported kwin though
2019-02-02 03:47:02	_diamondburned_	o
2019-02-02 03:47:08	_diamondburned_	Eh that's still sad
2019-02-02 03:48:09	ahrs	Building it was a pain. You need eglexternalplatform (https://github.com/NVIDIA/eglexternalplatform) and egl-wayland (https://github.com/NVIDIA/egl-wayland)

2019-02-02 03:48:23	ahrs	For XWayland you need to build it with eglstreams support
2019-02-02 03:48:58	ahrs	If anything fucks up (like it did the first time I tried) everything falls back to shitty llvmpipe software rendering too which is "fun"

2019-02-02 03:51:18	ahrs	Same but if this means no more screen tearing / flickering in Plasma it'll temporarily delay it
2019-02-02 03:51:50	Stve	why do they not just do wayland
2019-02-02 03:52:08	 *	ahrs Because it's Nvidia
2019-02-02 03:52:19	ahrs	This is proper Wayland too the difference is in the drivers
2019-02-02 03:52:38	Stve	can they write kiwmi for me
2019-02-02 03:52:42	ahrs	Literally every other driver uses GBM but Nvidia being Nvidia has to use their own special standard (eglstreams)

2019-02-02 03:52:56	Bear	Only reason I fucked with setting up Nvidia drivers was to get rid of awful tearing.
2019-02-02 03:53:42	Bear	Haven't even looked into wayland.
2019-02-02 03:53:48	Bear	Fucked with it once using Sway.
2019-02-02 03:53:57	Bear	But honestly couldn't be fucked to use it at the moment.
2019-02-02 03:54:02	ahrs	I need to see if using dual-gpus (Nvidia+Intel) works. Right now I have no framebuffer because Nvidia doesn't know how to write a driver for the tty properly.

2019-02-02 03:59:41	natemonster321	so gay
2019-02-02 04:00:49	ahrs	Grub supposedly fixes it but then I'd have to use grub...

2019-02-02 04:02:20	davidv7	so reddit decided to change themes on every click
2019-02-02 04:03:10	ahrs	Reddit's dark theme is also completely broken. Page loads, bright flash of white and then the dark theme kicks in
2019-02-02 04:03:30	davidv7	yeah
2019-02-02 04:04:26	davidv7	twitch has a similar issue, but it loads up the empty UI elements... then refreshes the entire page where it actually loads the UI
2019-02-02 04:04:31	davidv7	i hate the web
2019-02-02 04:05:13	_diamondburned_	I tried theming it
2019-02-02 04:05:18	_diamondburned_	It's too trashy tho
2019-02-02 04:05:23	_diamondburned_	@davidv7 dw it's just reddit
2019-02-02 04:06:45	davidv7	what pisses me off is that its just text,image text image and nothing else lol
2019-02-02 04:07:05	davidv7	at least twitch has to load a lot of streams etc.

2019-02-02 06:09:16	jb	just feedback, like i3lock
2019-02-02 06:09:52	jb	random portions of the wheel get lighted up (in red) for normal output, the wheel itself goes red if your password is wrong etc.

2019-02-02 06:10:57	jb	a nice thing it has is image caching, so you can lock into your bg without loading it everytime you do so. it's pretty simple stuff, but it really speeds up the locking time in comparision with other barebones screenlock utils

2019-02-02 06:12:01	jb	it's better than embedding the native lib into simpler shit
2019-02-02 06:12:27	davidv7	i dont like any lockscreens for wms
2019-02-02 06:12:38	davidv7	i prefer to just go to lightdm and i use xlock sometimes too

2019-02-02 06:17:58	jb	at least none publicized

2019-02-02 06:19:03	_diamondburned_	yeah because their old server was bloated as fuck
2019-02-02 06:19:13	_diamondburned_	guy's name was qwerty something right?
2019-02-02 06:19:26	_diamondburned_	just confirming the right guy

2019-02-02 06:22:28	_diamondburned_	tbh
2019-02-02 06:22:46	_diamondburned_	I got swept up onto the nodejs craze shortly after
2019-02-02 06:22:56	_diamondburned_	and that was 3 months of brainfucking
2019-02-02 06:22:58	_diamondburned_	dealing with async
2019-02-02 06:23:10	jb	you never used python's async lib?

2019-02-02 06:23:57	_diamondburned_	comparing to asyncio
2019-02-02 06:23:59	jb	one thing I can't complain about Python is that the asyncio lib is very easy to use

2019-02-02 06:24:44	_diamondburned_	yeah I kinda do
2019-02-02 06:24:45	_diamondburned_	and not
2019-02-02 06:24:47	_diamondburned_	at the same time
2019-02-02 06:24:53	jb	otherwise you gotta wrap your head around spaghetti code and runtime issues you don't normaly deal with an imperative paradigm

2019-02-02 06:27:33	_diamondburned_	no point
2019-02-02 06:27:46	_diamondburned_	and you're not supposed to distribute Go code
2019-02-02 06:27:47	_diamondburned_	just a heads up
2019-02-02 06:27:53	_diamondburned_	the way it's meant to be is to be used as a binary
2019-02-02 06:27:56	jb	no? wtf
2019-02-02 06:27:59	_diamondburned_	I don't give a fuck though, I code for myself
2019-02-02 06:28:03	_diamondburned_	yup, that's how it is

2019-02-02 06:28:10	_diamondburned_	unless you want to compile, you distribute binaries

2019-02-02 06:28:21	yemou	but im a simple python baby
2019-02-02 06:28:21	_diamondburned_	it's not
2019-02-02 06:28:23	_diamondburned_	believe it or not
2019-02-02 06:28:24	jb	doesn't help if community improvement
2019-02-02 06:28:31	jb	or with trust in software
2019-02-02 06:28:32	_diamondburned_	nodoby forces you to install an entire 200MB compiler toolset
2019-02-02 06:28:35	jb	blackbox issue
2019-02-02 06:28:37	_diamondburned_	well jokes on you
2019-02-02 06:28:41	_diamondburned_	the shit on Arch are all binaries
2019-02-02 06:28:42	_diamondburned_	🤷
2019-02-02 06:28:45	_diamondburned_	people use it all the time
2019-02-02 06:28:48	_diamondburned_	across all distros
2019-02-02 06:28:53	_diamondburned_	I don't see any problems with it

2019-02-02 06:29:15	IgnisCyan	worst god ever
2019-02-02 06:29:16	jb	if people don't even check what they're downloading when using arch...
2019-02-02 06:29:32	jb	do people really do that
2019-02-02 06:29:36	_diamondburned_	yup
2019-02-02 06:29:41	jb	ugh
2019-02-02 06:29:43	_diamondburned_	all the Arch repositories distribute binaries
2019-02-02 06:29:50	_diamondburned_	you'd have to use Gentoo or something to compile it from source
2019-02-02 06:29:55	yemou	unless you do aur in arch
2019-02-02 06:29:58	_diamondburned_	^
2019-02-02 06:30:02	_diamondburned_	some AUR packages actually ship bins
2019-02-02 06:30:03	jb	ik dude
2019-02-02 06:30:05	_diamondburned_	so you don't have to compile
2019-02-02 06:30:08	_diamondburned_	vscode is one
2019-02-02 06:30:24	jb	but the binaries are more of a help, since (except for proprietary software) you can look at the source code anyway
2019-02-02 06:30:43	_diamondburned_	well then that's not exactly how Go works, it's pretty awkward that way

2019-02-02 06:30:48	xent	aaand i cant open terminal :/
2019-02-02 06:30:51	yemou	i am confuse
2019-02-02 06:31:02	IgnisCyan	mod + enter xent?
2019-02-02 06:31:03	_diamondburned_	Go apps should be designed so that you compile it once, and it's immediately deployable
2019-02-02 06:31:05	yemou	@xent did you set the correct terminal in the config
2019-02-02 06:31:12	_diamondburned_	you're not supposed to recompile it for minor changes, etc
2019-02-02 06:31:13	jb	hm
2019-02-02 06:31:19	ahrs	You get a miniscule (so small it's not even worth measuring) performance increase from compiling things
2019-02-02 06:31:21	_diamondburned_	+ this is why GitLab is epic
2019-02-02 06:31:22	xent	oh
2019-02-02 06:31:29	_diamondburned_	I just hit the CI and have it compile
2019-02-02 06:31:33	xent	ok
2019-02-02 06:31:35	_diamondburned_	then I can tell people to grab the artifacts
2019-02-02 06:31:46	_diamondburned_	and since you could disable CGO in Go, it's completely statically linked
2019-02-02 06:31:51	_diamondburned_	you could even run it in Alpine and NixOS
2019-02-02 06:31:57	_diamondburned_	(at tdeo)
2019-02-02 06:32:02	jb	now I can see how that is actually useful
2019-02-02 06:32:02	xent	so whats i3 default file manager if there is one
2019-02-02 06:32:11	_diamondburned_	yeah GitLab is 😩
2019-02-02 06:32:15	jb	albeit at the loss of those things I mentioned for open source stuff
2019-02-02 06:32:18	_diamondburned_	why is GitHub even a thing
2019-02-02 06:32:21	IgnisCyan	Wait wait
2019-02-02 06:32:26	_diamondburned_	nah I have my source code all stored in GitLab
2019-02-02 06:32:26	IgnisCyan	what's the difference between gitlab and github
2019-02-02 06:32:32	IgnisCyan	I actually don't know this
2019-02-02 06:32:33	_diamondburned_	my entire coding career I've never made anything prop before
2019-02-02 06:32:34	_diamondburned_	promise
2019-02-02 06:32:38	_diamondburned_	GitLab has a CI
2019-02-02 06:32:42	_diamondburned_	and a (subjectively) better/worse UI
2019-02-02 06:32:56	_diamondburned_	depending on your type, GitLab's UI might be the best thing ever
2019-02-02 06:32:58	_diamondburned_	or the worst
2019-02-02 06:32:58	jb	I like Github's UI design more. but yeah, that's a matter of taste
2019-02-02 06:33:02	_diamondburned_	yeah most do
2019-02-02 06:33:04	_diamondburned_	you're fine
2019-02-02 06:33:07	_diamondburned_	I'm the weird one here
2019-02-02 06:33:17	_diamondburned_	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/361910177961738244/541023258070351892/unknown.png
2019-02-02 06:33:18	IgnisCyan	I heard about gitlab when Firefox announced their logo redesign
2019-02-02 06:33:25	jb	Aren't We All The Weird Ones In Life
2019-02-02 06:33:27	IgnisCyan	because it legit looks like they just copy and pasted gitlabs logo
2019-02-02 06:33:27	IgnisCyan	lol
2019-02-02 06:33:28	xent	ok terminal open

2019-02-02 06:33:35	_diamondburned_	sidebar
2019-02-02 06:33:40	_diamondburned_	sidebar is super duper useful
2019-02-02 06:33:48	_diamondburned_	you could hop pages without going through extra ones
2019-02-02 06:33:56	_diamondburned_	also GitLab's mobile UI is superior comparing to GitHub's
2019-02-02 06:34:00	_diamondburned_	and remember built in CI
2019-02-02 06:34:02	_diamondburned_	super easy to use
2019-02-02 06:34:07	jb	yeah, mobile github is crap
2019-02-02 06:34:12	jb	even more so with recent changes
2019-02-02 06:34:26	jb	everything gets cramped into the screen and text easily falls of boundaries
2019-02-02 06:34:39	_diamondburned_	all you need for CI
2019-02-02 06:34:39	_diamondburned_	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/361910177961738244/541023603584532500/unknown.png
2019-02-02 06:34:42	_diamondburned_	just make a file
2019-02-02 06:34:43	jb	plus you don't get to see the source right away. just the readme
2019-02-02 06:34:43	_diamondburned_	change some stuff
2019-02-02 06:34:44	_diamondburned_	hit save
2019-02-02 06:34:47	_diamondburned_	bam, it builds for you
2019-02-02 06:34:51	_diamondburned_	artifacts go to where it should be
2019-02-02 06:34:58	_diamondburned_	(yeah i know the theme looks out of place)
2019-02-02 06:35:11	_diamondburned_	(I refuse to look at code on light theme)
2019-02-02 06:35:18	jb	fair enough
2019-02-02 06:35:44	xent	how do i switch to i3-gaps

2019-02-02 06:36:18	jb	there isn't anything else to do besides that
2019-02-02 06:36:27	_diamondburned_	log out
2019-02-02 06:36:28	_diamondburned_	change session
2019-02-02 06:36:30	_diamondburned_	log back in
2019-02-02 06:37:00	IgnisCyan	I can't tell whether I like gaps or no gaps more
2019-02-02 06:37:08	IgnisCyan	I feel like aesthetically its nicer to have gaps but
2019-02-02 06:37:21	davidv7	there's not much thought to it
2019-02-02 06:37:26	davidv7	you like gaps or not
2019-02-02 06:37:41	_diamondburned_	tbh
2019-02-02 06:37:41	_diamondburned_	I don't like gaps
2019-02-02 06:37:48	_diamondburned_	the only "gaps" thing I would have is terminal padding
2019-02-02 06:37:50	_diamondburned_	and that's it
2019-02-02 06:37:57	IgnisCyan	do you code in nvim diamond?
2019-02-02 06:38:01	_diamondburned_	yes
2019-02-02 06:38:02	jb	gaps with shading though :uwu: <https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/536583749161451541.png>
2019-02-02 06:38:03	_diamondburned_	I do now
2019-02-02 06:38:07	IgnisCyan	If I use vscode
2019-02-02 06:38:09	_diamondburned_	wdym with shading :thonk: <https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/451159467883626500.png>
2019-02-02 06:38:12	IgnisCyan	is there reason to switch?
2019-02-02 06:38:16	jb	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/361910177961738244/541024514474115072/unknown.png
2019-02-02 06:38:18	_diamondburned_	not exactly
2019-02-02 06:38:25	_diamondburned_	I was fed up with vscode because of how slow it is
2019-02-02 06:38:30	_diamondburned_	if it's fast for you, you're fine
2019-02-02 06:38:32	IgnisCyan	It's slow?
2019-02-02 06:38:39	_diamondburned_	took fucking 8 seconds to format a fucking file
2019-02-02 06:38:40	davidv7	nvim is much nsappier
2019-02-02 06:38:40	_diamondburned_	like what the fuck
2019-02-02 06:38:43	davidv7	EDIT: nvim is much snappier
2019-02-02 06:38:50	_diamondburned_	running the thing from terminal takes 0.008s
2019-02-02 06:38:57	_diamondburned_	nvim does it *instantly* the moment I insert stuff
2019-02-02 06:38:59	ahrs	Vscode's vim-emulation is (unsurprisingly) not as good as Vim. Don't know if that's a reason to switch though.
2019-02-02 06:39:16	xent	do i just `sudo apt install i3-gaps`
2019-02-02 06:39:18	_diamondburned_	EDIT: nvim does it *instantly* the moment I insert stuff (slower than .008s obviously, but you get the idea)
2019-02-02 06:39:21	xent	or git clone
2019-02-02 06:39:25	ahrs	git clone
2019-02-02 06:39:26	_diamondburned_	git clone
2019-02-02 06:39:29	xent	ok
2019-02-02 06:39:33	ahrs	There's no package for i3-gaps
2019-02-02 06:39:33	_diamondburned_	i3-gaps isn't even in the repo is it
2019-02-02 06:39:35	_diamondburned_	ye
2019-02-02 06:39:38	xent	o
2019-02-02 06:39:39	IgnisCyan	The fork I sent is in the repo
2019-02-02 06:39:42	_diamondburned_	ok but ngl
2019-02-02 06:39:48	_diamondburned_	doing shit in vscode is easy as hell
2019-02-02 06:39:52	ahrs	`apt build-dep i3wm` to get the dependencies
2019-02-02 06:39:59	_diamondburned_	i would get a dope popup telling me the structure of something I'm writing
2019-02-02 06:40:03	xent	so
2019-02-02 06:40:05	_diamondburned_	or autocomplete what's in the struct
2019-02-02 06:40:08	_diamondburned_	and what its type is
2019-02-02 06:40:11	_diamondburned_	or what a function needs
2019-02-02 06:40:14	ahrs	EDIT: `apt build-dep i3-wm` to get the dependencies
2019-02-02 06:40:16	_diamondburned_	I don't get those in nvim
2019-02-02 06:40:21	_diamondburned_	(I do, I just suck at bindings)
2019-02-02 06:40:25	_diamondburned_	so I just look at godocs
2019-02-02 06:40:26	_diamondburned_	kek
2019-02-02 06:40:31	xent	`git clone https;//githun` `apt build-dep i3wm`
2019-02-02 06:40:38	xent	do that?
2019-02-02 06:40:38	jb	there's a plugin for snippets that includes popups for info like that, though
2019-02-02 06:40:42	_diamondburned_	I know
2019-02-02 06:40:44	_diamondburned_	it's in python
2019-02-02 06:40:47	jb	depending on the language you're writing on
2019-02-02 06:40:47	xent	where do i do it in
2019-02-02 06:40:48	_diamondburned_	and I don't want a slow workflow
2019-02-02 06:40:54	jb	kek

2019-02-02 07:03:55	xent	i knocked down some
2019-02-02 07:04:52	jb	either that or rollback to the latest release
2019-02-02 07:05:38	xent	ok
2019-02-02 07:05:54	_diamondburned_	ok
2019-02-02 07:06:23	xent	do i just unzip the file
2019-02-02 07:06:26	xent	release
2019-02-02 07:06:47	jb	I mean, checkout the release commit
2019-02-02 07:07:08	jb	but sure. you can just use the release tarball instead of compiling i3-gaps yourself
2019-02-02 07:07:26	xent	the what
2019-02-02 07:07:31	xent	.tar.gz?
2019-02-02 07:07:31	jb	tarball
2019-02-02 07:07:32	jb	zip file
2019-02-02 07:07:33	Sacul	The Talos Principle is such a well programmed and optimized unity game, right now it's using a little more than 1GB of ram
2019-02-02 07:07:58	Sacul	And the graphics setting are ridiculously deep wtf
2019-02-02 07:08:09	xent	should i delete the i3-gaps directory
2019-02-02 07:08:12	Sacul	Had never heard about half of those lol
2019-02-02 07:08:17	jb	only if you want to
2019-02-02 07:08:21	jb	it's a clone of the repo, anyway
2019-02-02 07:08:30	xent	if i have the .tar.gz
2019-02-02 07:08:45	jb	if you're just going to install it from the tarball, then probs no
2019-02-02 07:08:46	Plasma	Yikes I’m gonna try getting back on arch tonight
2019-02-02 07:08:51	ahrs	There should be no real difference between the tarball and git repo if you have the same tag checked out
2019-02-02 07:08:52	Plasma	Haven’t used arch in months
2019-02-02 07:08:56	xent	ok\

2019-02-02 07:09:14	xent	so how would i go the tarball way
2019-02-02 07:09:16	jb	plus, the guy didn't check the dependencies for compiling it
2019-02-02 07:09:27	jb	`tar xvf file.tar.gz`
2019-02-02 07:09:31	Plasma	@Sacul what distro are you using these days
2019-02-02 07:09:50	oxycodone	inb4 void
2019-02-02 07:09:53	ahrs	That's why I said earlier to `apt build-dep i3-wm` but it's possible you need extra dependencies since your building a newer version
2019-02-02 07:10:08	xent	ok
2019-02-02 07:10:08	jb	they literally skipped 3 steps on your tut

2019-02-02 07:12:38	jb	that explains why it looks good
2019-02-02 07:12:46	Sacul	uwu

2019-02-02 07:13:10	Sacul	No clue
2019-02-02 07:13:19	Sacul	But it has a beta vulkan support

2019-02-02 07:17:59	Jake_Moon	I have a great idea, why not just download the whole repository?
2019-02-02 07:18:08	jb	he did that

2019-02-02 07:20:47	xent	ok
2019-02-02 07:20:50	jb	the command is just getting the dependencies for that package
2019-02-02 07:20:55	jb	so you can install i3-gaps
2019-02-02 07:20:56	xent	well `sudo apt build-dep i3-wm` didnt work

2019-02-02 07:22:01	jb	oh. did you not run `apt-get update` or is apt just being dumb and looking for that package in other repos? :thonk: <https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/451159467883626500.png>
2019-02-02 07:22:45	jb	no, it's there. weird

2019-02-02 07:26:43	jb	weird nitpick
2019-02-02 07:26:56	ahrs	Use a browser extension to make it dark

2019-02-02 07:33:29	xent	do i upgrade aswell
2019-02-02 07:33:47	jb	you don't need to
2019-02-02 07:33:54	xent	ok
2019-02-02 07:33:55	jb	but now you should run build-deps
2019-02-02 07:33:57	jb	for i3
2019-02-02 07:34:01	xent	ok
2019-02-02 07:34:15	_diamondburned_	that's fucking retarded
2019-02-02 07:34:17	_diamondburned_	just use sudo tee
2019-02-02 07:34:27	xent	`sudo apt build-dep i3-wm` do this now?
2019-02-02 07:34:33	jb	yeah
2019-02-02 07:34:48	jb	also, kinda late there
2019-02-02 07:34:55	_diamondburned_	I know
2019-02-02 07:34:55	xent	`E: You must put some 'source' URIs in your sources.list`
2019-02-02 07:34:59	_diamondburned_	I was in the bathroom
2019-02-02 07:35:04	jb	kek
2019-02-02 07:35:24	ahrs	Add `deb-src` to the file you added
2019-02-02 07:35:29	jb	good thing you're committed on shitting on other people's (bad) choices tho
2019-02-02 07:35:45	ahrs	```bash

2019-02-02 07:35:45	ahrs	```
2019-02-02 07:36:02	ahrs	Then `apt update` and `apt build-dep i3-wm`
2019-02-02 07:37:21	xent	ok
2019-02-02 07:37:43	xent	works !
2019-02-02 07:39:19	xent	now i do the rest of the guide you posted?
2019-02-02 07:39:32	ahrs	Yeah. It should work.
2019-02-02 07:39:54	ahrs	If it doesn't check the Wiki on Github, they probably have up-to-date instructions
2019-02-02 07:39:55	xent	ok
2019-02-02 07:40:02	Jake_Moon	Why'd it have to be so difficult to build a file?
2019-02-02 07:40:25	jb	if things were supposed to be easy by default, there wouldn't be instructions
2019-02-02 07:40:28	Jake_Moon	What's different in this case then just going into /home/user and doing a command?
2019-02-02 07:40:36	ahrs	If you have all of the dependencies it's usually not that difficult.
2019-02-02 07:40:54	Jake_Moon	Oh
2019-02-02 07:41:37	ahrs	There are instructions to help you out but usually you can build anything with the same commands once you know how.

2019-02-02 07:45:44	lidl_papi	@Iamriles what do you use it for?

2019-02-02 07:46:17	xent	hmmm
2019-02-02 07:46:19	xent	rust
2019-02-02 07:46:21	xent	or go
2019-02-02 07:46:29	ahrs	Did you do `autoreconf --force --install`?
2019-02-02 07:46:29	lidl_papi	C
2019-02-02 07:46:33	lidl_papi	start with C
2019-02-02 07:46:36	xent	ok
2019-02-02 07:46:39	lidl_papi	or you'll regret later
2019-02-02 07:46:46	xent	ok
2019-02-02 07:46:59	jb	learning C as a first programming lang in 2019, though
2019-02-02 07:47:00	Iamriles	I would start with C and C++
2019-02-02 07:47:12	jb	you could use something more didatic before actually programming real applications
2019-02-02 07:47:20	jb	like Ruby
2019-02-02 07:47:30	xent	hmmm
2019-02-02 07:47:31	lidl_papi	well, if he's getting into linux now
2019-02-02 07:47:35	lidl_papi	he might as well get into suckless
2019-02-02 07:47:39	jb	kek
2019-02-02 07:47:40	Iamriles	You need to know stack vs heap and other memory suff imo
2019-02-02 07:47:42	lidl_papi	and it will be usefull then
2019-02-02 07:47:50	_diamondburned_	>Ruby
2019-02-02 07:47:51	_diamondburned_	🤢
2019-02-02 07:47:55	_diamondburned_	muh performancec
2019-02-02 07:47:57	_diamondburned_	EDIT: muh performance
2019-02-02 07:47:57	lidl_papi	i like ruby syntax tbqh
2019-02-02 07:48:03	Iamriles	@xent what do you want to do
2019-02-02 07:48:06	jb	"something more didatic"
2019-02-02 07:48:07	_diamondburned_	I think there's Crystal or sth for Ruby
2019-02-02 07:48:09	_diamondburned_	and it's faster
2019-02-02 07:48:10	_diamondburned_	idk tho
2019-02-02 07:48:11	jb	yeah
2019-02-02 07:48:12	lidl_papi	yeah
2019-02-02 07:48:13	_diamondburned_	I hate Ruby's syntax
2019-02-02 07:48:17	jb	it's because it's just C
2019-02-02 07:48:20	xent	make an application
2019-02-02 07:48:20	jb	ran through an interpreter
2019-02-02 07:48:23	_diamondburned_	yea
2019-02-02 07:48:29	jb	so you can program with a different syntax
2019-02-02 07:48:33	xent	that has a button that plays sound
2019-02-02 07:48:35	ahrs	I hate ruby
2019-02-02 07:48:39	Iamriles	Like a mobile app?
2019-02-02 07:48:42	jb	hm
2019-02-02 07:48:43	xent	no
2019-02-02 07:48:44	Iamriles	Or what?
2019-02-02 07:48:46	xent	desktop app
2019-02-02 07:48:59	_diamondburned_	C++
2019-02-02 07:48:59	_diamondburned_	kek
2019-02-02 07:48:59	xent	`autoreconf: 'configure.ac' or 'configure.in' is required` still what do
2019-02-02 07:49:00	Iamriles	Yeah learn C then
2019-02-02 07:49:06	lidl_papi	C
2019-02-02 07:49:08	_diamondburned_	C++ both has Qt and Gtk
2019-02-02 07:49:13	_diamondburned_	I don't think Qt has C bindings
2019-02-02 07:49:14	_diamondburned_	but eh
2019-02-02 07:49:15	_diamondburned_	whatever tbh
2019-02-02 07:49:17	_diamondburned_	if you want a button
2019-02-02 07:49:19	_diamondburned_	even HTML will do
2019-02-02 07:49:25	lidl_papi	yeah but he's just starting
2019-02-02 07:49:27	_diamondburned_	HTML + electron if you want to just fucking be done with it
2019-02-02 07:49:31	_diamondburned_	1 line of html + electron
2019-02-02 07:49:32	_diamondburned_	done
2019-02-02 07:49:32	ahrs	@xent `ls -al` Is there no configure.in or configure.ac file?
2019-02-02 07:50:00	xent	no
2019-02-02 07:50:06	lidl_papi	@xent C is for cool kids
2019-02-02 07:50:09	jb	the dude doesn't even know how to use his package manager. at least something to get him hitting the ground running should be considered
2019-02-02 07:50:23	xent	lmao

2019-02-02 07:51:10	_diamondburned_	the fact that he can't install something doesn't make me mad

2019-02-02 07:51:59	jb	I mentioned it because it speaks to how much he can handle shit by himself, without getting heavy-handedly tutored
2019-02-02 07:52:03	_diamondburned_	I've seen better kids

2019-02-02 07:52:16	_diamondburned_	the guy who developed the Reaction Role bot is actually one year younger than I am
2019-02-02 07:52:21	Iamriles	@xent it'll be a while before youll be able to make a gui app FYI. If you want to make something fast and don't care about learning memory management then look at JS + electron, but beware I WILL fun of you for using electron.
2019-02-02 07:52:22	_diamondburned_	~~mfw inferiority complex~~

2019-02-02 07:52:51	_diamondburned_	basically Kubernetes, orchestration and shit
2019-02-02 07:53:01	_diamondburned_	I think it's too overcomplicated
2019-02-02 07:53:02	_diamondburned_	but whatever
2019-02-02 07:53:05	_diamondburned_	it's fun and I learn shit from it
2019-02-02 07:53:06	Iamriles	I should look into a rust discord bot.
2019-02-02 07:53:07	_diamondburned_	so why not
2019-02-02 07:53:17	_diamondburned_	it's good to use him as my experimental subject
2019-02-02 07:53:24	jb	there's a copy of RedBot in rust iirc
2019-02-02 07:53:29	_diamondburned_	then I'll design my own orchestration flow
2019-02-02 07:53:52	jb	treating people as means, and not as ends in themselves
2019-02-02 07:53:52	Iamriles	There's also discord-rs
2019-02-02 07:53:55	jb	Kant would be ashamed
2019-02-02 07:54:08	_diamondburned_	awt
2019-02-02 07:54:10	_diamondburned_	EDIT: wat
2019-02-02 07:54:15	jb	nvm it
2019-02-02 07:54:25	jb	don't you study philosophy on high school?
2019-02-02 07:54:25	_diamondburned_	I'm not wasting a couple of bucks to rent 30 servers lmao
2019-02-02 07:54:30	xent	ok
2019-02-02 07:54:33	xent	its working
2019-02-02 07:54:40	_diamondburned_	he's doing cross server orchestrating
2019-02-02 07:54:44	_diamondburned_	that shit isn't easy at all
2019-02-02 07:54:47	_diamondburned_	so i'm not risking it
2019-02-02 07:54:54	jb	guess not
2019-02-02 07:54:58	_diamondburned_	once he got it working I'll try it myself
2019-02-02 07:55:05	_diamondburned_	might actually land me a job kek
2019-02-02 07:55:22	_diamondburned_	better than getting one huge ass dedicated server and paying $200/mo for it
2019-02-02 07:55:27	_diamondburned_	instead I just pay $30/mo
2019-02-02 07:55:34	xent	just buy an irl server
2019-02-02 07:55:38	_diamondburned_	why?
2019-02-02 07:55:44	lidl_papi	just buy 50 thinkpads for like 10 bucks each
2019-02-02 07:55:49	jb	buy a rack and glue it to the wall
2019-02-02 07:55:51	jb	done
2019-02-02 07:55:54	xent	so you can say i have an irl server
2019-02-02 07:55:59	_diamondburned_	that's pointless
2019-02-02 07:56:02	_diamondburned_	I had some at one point
2019-02-02 07:56:06	_diamondburned_	they were all pointless
2019-02-02 07:56:11	_diamondburned_	>50 thinkpads
2019-02-02 07:56:11	_diamondburned_	that's horizontal scaling
2019-02-02 07:56:12	_diamondburned_	kek
2019-02-02 07:56:15	xent	you get all  the clout though
2019-02-02 07:56:18	_diamondburned_	no I don't
2019-02-02 07:56:27	xent	yes
2019-02-02 07:56:28	_diamondburned_	my network bandwidth is very limited comparing to a datacenter
2019-02-02 07:56:34	jb	local servers are a waste of resources if they are not for home usage anyway
2019-02-02 07:56:37	_diamondburned_	^
2019-02-02 07:56:41	xent	just like arch users, ALL the clout
2019-02-02 07:56:44	jb	you can get better service for less than you're paying to mantain them
2019-02-02 07:56:46	_diamondburned_	cloud*
2019-02-02 07:56:48	_diamondburned_	I had some
2019-02-02 07:56:52	_diamondburned_	I used to host servers at home
2019-02-02 07:56:54	_diamondburned_	I know how bad they are
2019-02-02 07:56:55	_diamondburned_	kek
2019-02-02 07:56:56	xent	lol
2019-02-02 07:57:02	_diamondburned_	if I could hit the horiz scale sweet spot
2019-02-02 07:57:02	jb	oof
2019-02-02 07:57:08	_diamondburned_	maybe $3.50/mo each
2019-02-02 07:57:14	_diamondburned_	then scale across 10 of them
2019-02-02 07:57:22	_diamondburned_	yea shouldn't be hard
2019-02-02 07:57:32	lidl_papi	rent 30 servers for a day with hourly billing
2019-02-02 07:57:37	jb	if your income is actually decent, you won't need to worry about being on such a budget
2019-02-02 07:57:37	_diamondburned_	just Kubernetes it across
2019-02-02 07:57:42	jb	and you do have skills
2019-02-02 07:58:04	_diamondburned_	horizontal scaling is still better than buying one huge dedicated server though
2019-02-02 07:58:10	_diamondburned_	cheaper isn't its only advantage
2019-02-02 07:58:20	_diamondburned_	and minimizing the cost of operation is a huge thing for a company too
2019-02-02 07:58:22	xent	do i reboot after install
2019-02-02 07:58:24	_diamondburned_	money just doesn't come out of nowhere
2019-02-02 07:58:39	xent	yes i do
2019-02-02 07:58:42	jb	hence "if your income is actually decent"
2019-02-02 07:58:47	xent	brb
2019-02-02 07:58:48	_diamondburned_	no, not my income
2019-02-02 07:58:48	lidl_papi	sometimes it feels like it in companies
2019-02-02 07:58:54	_diamondburned_	I'm talking about the company in general
2019-02-02 07:58:57	_diamondburned_	could be a start-up company
2019-02-02 07:59:14	_diamondburned_	horiz scaling is always cheaper than getting one huge dedicated server
2019-02-02 07:59:37	jb	I thought starters usually had the worst accountability since they don't lend the task to third partities or subside it themselves more neatly
2019-02-02 07:59:50	jb	at least, it's an issue I've seen with friend's starters
2019-02-02 08:00:09	ahrs	You don't want one huge server anyway. If that server goes down you lose everything. If you scale horizontally things (potentially) keep working
2019-02-02 08:00:11	_diamondburned_	welp, I had no fucking idea about your friends' starters, I just want to try and minimize the cost
2019-02-02 08:00:14	_diamondburned_	yeah
2019-02-02 08:00:20	_diamondburned_	except if Discord dies
2019-02-02 08:00:21	_diamondburned_	lmao
2019-02-02 08:00:25	xent	now i'm gonna learn vim
2019-02-02 08:00:28	jb	yeah. you got a better plan than they had
2019-02-02 08:00:30	_diamondburned_	which is why my friend's overcomplicating
2019-02-02 08:00:31	jb	props
2019-02-02 08:00:41	_diamondburned_	he wants a few shards to communicate with Discord
2019-02-02 08:00:47	_diamondburned_	and another working independently
2019-02-02 08:00:53	_diamondburned_	I think it's fucking useless
2019-02-02 08:00:54	_diamondburned_	but whatever

2019-02-02 08:04:24	_diamondburned_	oh talking about large bots
2019-02-02 08:04:29	_diamondburned_	the guy who I was talking about
2019-02-02 08:04:36	_diamondburned_	he talked to the guy who made Dyno
2019-02-02 08:04:39	_diamondburned_	Dyno has crazy scaling
2019-02-02 08:04:59	_diamondburned_	Dyno guy even maintains his own discordgo forks
2019-02-02 08:05:04	jb	isn't it's config API shit though
2019-02-02 08:05:11	_diamondburned_	depends
2019-02-02 08:05:12	ahrs	@xent If you had i3 installed before you installed i3-gaps you want to remove it (`apt remove i3-gaps`). You don't want i3 and i3-gaps installed at the same time.
2019-02-02 08:05:19	_diamondburned_	it heavily depends on what the bot's use is
2019-02-02 08:05:28	_diamondburned_	whether or not it depends on a database
2019-02-02 08:05:29	_diamondburned_	etc
2019-02-02 08:05:35	_diamondburned_	it's not "just config api"

2019-02-02 08:05:49	xent	fuk
2019-02-02 08:05:52	jb	yeah. I never got around at using it for anything besides limitting chat flow and deleting spam
2019-02-02 08:05:54	_diamondburned_	look at all those pods
2019-02-02 08:05:55	jb	i.e. the defaults
2019-02-02 08:06:08	_diamondburned_	they have 3-4 shards in one pod
2019-02-02 08:06:16	_diamondburned_	then deploy multiple pods across servers
2019-02-02 08:06:18	jb	but trying to configure any other functionality was a pain, because the website wasn't responsive, and it took awhile for the modules to load
2019-02-02 08:06:19	_diamondburned_	using Kubernetes
2019-02-02 08:06:20	xent	so `apt remove i3-wm` and eboot
2019-02-02 08:06:21	_diamondburned_	at least I was told

2019-02-02 08:06:33	lidl_papi	how do they earn money form these bots

2019-02-02 08:06:39	_diamondburned_	Dyno Gold or sth

2019-02-02 08:06:46	lidl_papi	no way anyone donates to them
2019-02-02 08:06:46	jb	microtransactions
2019-02-02 08:06:48	_diamondburned_	like holy hell

2019-02-02 08:06:49	Sacul	Lmao this Talos Principle dlc has a very cool bbs ingame

2019-02-02 08:07:12	jb	like Rythm and Tatsumaki
2019-02-02 08:07:12	_diamondburned_	also seems like they also use Redis for cross-shard communication

2019-02-02 08:08:31	_diamondburned_	nah man
2019-02-02 08:08:41	_diamondburned_	you know how too many shards could lead to ws drops on DiscorD?
2019-02-02 08:08:42	xent	no it's more like "what a cool bot, i'll donate to the dev"

2019-02-02 08:08:50	_diamondburned_	because their services are complete trash
2019-02-02 08:09:02	_diamondburned_	some bots like Dyno runs their Premium ver on a completely separate server
2019-02-02 08:09:09	_diamondburned_	probably separate database too, not sure
2019-02-02 08:09:13	_diamondburned_	less guilds too
2019-02-02 08:09:15	_diamondburned_	so more stable
2019-02-02 08:09:29	_diamondburned_	though tbh, assuming Discord doesn't fuck up and one of those shards die
2019-02-02 08:09:34	_diamondburned_	a new one will just pop up
2019-02-02 08:09:45	_diamondburned_	hardest part is coordination and management for them
2019-02-02 08:09:47	_diamondburned_	but yeah
2019-02-02 08:09:52	_diamondburned_	that's the part we're figuringg out

2019-02-02 08:11:01	ahrs	@xent It could be your display manager not picking up the session file in `/usr/local/share/xsessions`
2019-02-02 08:11:14	xent	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2019-02-02 08:12:08	ahrs	Try this:

2019-02-02 08:12:08	ahrs	Ctrl+Alt+F3 (that should bring you to the tty assuming you have no other desktop to login to. You could use an Function key from F1-F10 one of them should give you a login prompt)

2019-02-02 08:38:42	ahrs	That's not a bad idea. Maybe you could run internet explorer in Wine and load up a website that reads epubs

2019-02-02 08:45:39	ahrs	If it does you just have to enable the gaps (they aren't enabled by default)

2019-02-02 08:50:36	ahrs	To make it permanent you have to edit `~/.config/i3/config`

2019-02-02 09:06:31	xent	might just install arch instead tbh
2019-02-02 09:06:57	Jake_Moon	@Bear You joke about using Arch, yet you don't see FreeBSD is fine also?
2019-02-02 09:07:15	xent	he doesn't joke?

2019-02-02 09:07:26	xent	what
2019-02-02 09:07:27	ahrs	Wait, the wiki says to install into `/usr` too, wow that's bad
2019-02-02 09:07:32	@gwu	python is such **SHIT**
2019-02-02 09:07:37	xent	yes
2019-02-02 09:07:45	@gwu	why can't i just change the user-site?
2019-02-02 09:08:00	Jake_Moon	People just dis Ubuntu because they choose convenience over "advanced" Linux user functionality.
2019-02-02 09:08:01	@gwu	ahrs: there is no icecat ebuild in any overlay...
2019-02-02 09:08:09	ahrs	Just use firefox
2019-02-02 09:08:15	Jake_Moon	Just use Tor
2019-02-02 09:08:18	me	try waterfox
2019-02-02 09:08:30	@gwu	Ayyden said icecat is really good
2019-02-02 09:08:37	@gwu	+ it looks pretty cool
2019-02-02 09:08:42	ahrs	Icecat is dumb. Even Debian has switched back to Firefox now.
2019-02-02 09:08:43	Jake_Moon	Routes all packages through Tor 😕 🤔 😐
2019-02-02 09:08:48	@gwu	oh
2019-02-02 09:08:53	@gwu	is it that dumb?
2019-02-02 09:09:23	xent	ok
2019-02-02 09:09:25	@gwu	Jake_Moon: there is a section on how to do that with emerge on the gentoo tor wiki page
2019-02-02 09:09:27	xent	installing arch
2019-02-02 09:09:32	xent	let's see how this goes
2019-02-02 09:09:39	@gwu	xent: good luck
2019-02-02 09:09:47	Jake_Moon	@grimm I know how to do it without a wiki though.
2019-02-02 09:09:49	xent	thanks i'll need it
2019-02-02 09:10:00	ahrs	`emerge tor`, `rc-service tor -v start` then just configure whatever to use the SOCKS proxy. Easy peasy.
2019-02-02 09:10:08	Jake_Moon	I know

2019-02-02 09:10:23	ahrs	Okular's good
2019-02-02 09:10:31	@gwu	aren't there a few more steps so that emerge doesn't die?
2019-02-02 09:10:44	ahrs	Install `kde-meta` to have some extra bloat with your bloat
2019-02-02 09:10:51	Jake_Moon	I did
2019-02-02 09:10:55	Jake_Moon	I got some games

2019-02-02 09:11:13	Bear	Are you on a retarded rant again?
2019-02-02 09:11:23	Jake_Moon	No, I installed everything kde
2019-02-02 09:11:29	Bear	I've never used BSD, so I don't have an opinion on it.
2019-02-02 09:11:34	Bear	Have never needed it.
2019-02-02 09:11:38	@gwu	bsd is great
2019-02-02 09:11:48	Bear	I've heard gud shit about it.
2019-02-02 09:11:48	@gwu	never could get it to work though
2019-02-02 09:11:52	@gwu	xD
2019-02-02 09:11:53	Bear	I just haven't felt the need to use it.
2019-02-02 09:11:59	Jake_Moon	Well, Arch is good and all, but I'd live with any distro.
2019-02-02 09:12:05	Bear	I doubt it.
2019-02-02 09:12:09	Bear	You're pretty retarded.
2019-02-02 09:12:20	Jake_Moon	FreeBSD just took forever to install all the packages
2019-02-02 09:12:21	@gwu	Jake_Moon: hanna montana linux

2019-02-02 11:12:09	qutebrowser_	.linux gnu linux
2019-02-02 11:12:09	urlinfo	description: I'd just like to interject for moment. What you're refering to as linux, is in fact, gnu/linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, gnu plus linux. linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning gnu system made useful by the gnu corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.
2019-02-02 11:12:09	urlinfo	 
2019-02-02 11:12:09	urlinfo	Many computer users run a modified version of the gnu system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of gnu which is widely used today is often called linux, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the gnu system, developed by the gnu Project.
2019-02-02 11:12:09	urlinfo	 
2019-02-02 11:12:09	urlinfo	There really is a linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. linux is normally used in combination with the gnu
2019-02-02 11:12:09	urlinfo	operating system: the whole system is basically gnu with linux added, or gnu/linux. All the so-called linux distributions are really distributions of gnu/linux.

2019-02-02 11:35:51	steamport	LLVM is probably helping Rust alot here
2019-02-02 11:35:53	MarkBeaks	god why is ```screenfetch``` so ugly

2019-02-03 04:44:06	Jake_Moon	You guys go crazy on Nvidia drivers

2019-02-03 04:44:49	Jake_Moon	So what's with Nvidia that people panic for every driver update?
2019-02-03 04:45:00	Jake_Moon	And half the time it breaks something graphically
2019-02-03 04:45:43	dyla	the open source drivers for amd and intel are good
2019-02-03 04:45:48	dyla	for nvidia they're bad
2019-02-03 04:45:59	natemonster321	nvidia prop drivers require a kernel module that has to be rebuilt for every new kernel
2019-02-03 04:46:00	natemonster321	so basically
2019-02-03 04:46:01	lidl_papi	nvidia bad closed

2019-02-03 11:06:24	Superuser_	and it uses the antergos install for DE
2019-02-03 11:06:24	_diamondburned_	1. get antergos
2019-02-03 11:06:24	_diamondburned_	2. remove repo
2019-02-03 11:06:24	_diamondburned_	3. modify os-reelase
2019-02-03 11:06:24	StandingBlock	So, the best experience I've had on Linux in the last 7 years is a custom install of Arch I did about 4 months ago, but during an update two things conflicted and killed pacman. So now I'm back at square one, I can either reinstall Arch and hope something like that doesn't happen again or test more to see if something is more stable
2019-02-03 11:06:24	StandingBlock	 
2019-02-03 11:06:24	StandingBlock	Like say, I fucking adore how smooth everything went on Arch but that update problem, which was noted by some other users  (Forgot the errors now since its been a week) seem to have had the same issue.
2019-02-03 11:06:25	Raid	I regret my decision
2019-02-03 11:06:26	_diamondburned_	EDIT: 1. get antergos

2019-02-03 11:10:05	Superuser_	whats me_cleaner?
2019-02-03 11:10:18	steamport	allows you to remove a large amount of the propietary Intel ME
2019-02-03 11:10:28	_diamondburned_	doesn't always work

2019-02-03 11:11:12	_diamondburned_	`content: ""`
2019-02-03 11:11:18	steamport	it DOES involve a bios flash
2019-02-03 11:11:19	_diamondburned_	that's just
2019-02-03 11:11:22	_diamondburned_	vaporizing it tho
2019-02-03 11:11:28	steamport	but most modern bios systems have bios recovery systems should you somehow fuck it up
2019-02-03 11:11:29	_diamondburned_	put it in a wrapper or sth

2019-02-03 11:11:54	Jake_Moon	Why not just install a BIOS to load after the BIOS?
2019-02-03 11:11:58	_diamondburned_	or text-color matching bg
2019-02-03 11:12:01	Jake_Moon	Like just  software?

2019-02-03 11:13:17	Jake_Moon	But you can
2019-02-03 11:13:19	Raid	Did I make myself clear with "arch install"?
2019-02-03 11:13:22	steamport	the HAP bit, and removing the partitions
2019-02-03 11:13:23	Raid	Go on
2019-02-03 11:13:39	steamport	the hilarious part
2019-02-03 11:13:45	_diamondburned_	is OpenAL just plug and play on platforms?
2019-02-03 11:13:46	Jake_Moon	You could accidentally forget a bootloader and or the EFI
2019-02-03 11:14:03	Anna	Thanks diamond, i color matched the fg
2019-02-03 11:14:08	steamport	```In August 2017, Russian company Positive Technologies (Dmitry Sklyarov) published a method to disable the ME via an undocumented built-in mode. As Intel has confirmed[44] the ME contains a switch to enable government authorities such as the NSA to make the ME go into High-Assurance Platform (HAP) mode after boot. This mode disables most of ME's functions.[45][46] It is authorized for use by government authorities only
2019-02-03 11:14:08	steamport	and is supposed to be available only in machines produced for them. Yet it turned out that most machines sold on the retail market can be tricked into activating the switch.[47][48]. Manipulation of the HAP bit was quickly incorporated into the me_cleaner project[49]. ```
2019-02-03 11:14:09	steamport	lol
2019-02-03 11:14:09	Jake_Moon	Then you better know how to use windows EFI partition to load Arch and fix it
2019-02-03 11:14:18	Raid	@steamport I've never used https://github.com/corna/me_cleaner is it helpful?

2019-02-03 11:15:27	Jake_Moon	You don't need a Arch usb to fix Arch
2019-02-03 11:15:28	_diamondburned_	how do you not know
2019-02-03 11:15:33	Jake_Moon	You could even fix that with DOS
2019-02-03 11:15:36	Raid	Once you install and you fuck up the bootloader, you can use the usb to chroot into it
2019-02-03 11:15:42	Raid	and fix the problem

2019-02-03 11:16:17	steamport	that's it.
2019-02-03 11:16:25	Jake_Moon	You only need to add the EFI partition anyways

2019-02-03 11:16:34	Raid	@steamport I get anxiety when I update bios and the bar gets stuck for a bit

2019-02-03 11:17:03	_diamondburned_	yeet
2019-02-03 11:17:15	steamport	then i realized that was probably some M-FLASH bug and that it went away when i pressed the power or reset button
2019-02-03 11:17:26	Raid	@Jake_Moon Again.. I'm saying installing arch lol
2019-02-03 11:17:31	steamport	the message still comes up on boot, but only for 5 seconds
2019-02-03 11:18:12	Raid	Once you break arch post install that is you fucking up and updated shit that interfere with other stuff and its hard to fix
2019-02-03 11:18:17	Raid	I understand that lol
2019-02-03 11:18:26	Jake_Moon	Oh, just installing?
2019-02-03 11:18:35	Jake_Moon	Then yeah, that's difficult to break it too badly.
2019-02-03 11:18:36	Raid	@steamport Is it even worth it though?
2019-02-03 11:18:43	Raid	What's the honest problem?
2019-02-03 11:18:51	steamport	@Raid it runs at ring negative 3
2019-02-03 11:18:57	steamport	there have been intel ME exploits in the past
2019-02-03 11:18:58	@gwu	good morning guys
2019-02-03 11:19:06	Raid	ME backdoor?
2019-02-03 11:19:11	steamport	plus there's no guarantees it's not a backdoor- yeah
2019-02-03 11:19:18	Raid	ah k
2019-02-03 11:19:25	steamport	again, if you do use me_cleaner
2019-02-03 11:19:33	steamport	make sure you have some way to recover from a fucky BIOS
2019-02-03 11:19:39	steamport	like some sort of bios recovery function
2019-02-03 11:19:50	steamport	or, on some mobos, you can just insert a FAT32 stick with a firmware file on it
2019-02-03 11:19:56	steamport	in a rear usb 2.0 port
2019-02-03 11:19:58	Raid	Dude u scaring me
2019-02-03 11:20:03	Raid	I'm gonna do research
2019-02-03 11:20:10	steamport	<https://github.com/corna/me_cleaner/wiki/How-does-it-work%3F>
2019-02-03 11:20:12	Raid	dealing with bios scares the shit out of me
2019-02-03 11:20:19	Jake_Moon	Intel ME, Windows ME, same difference.
2019-02-03 11:20:24	Raid	Is it possible to hard reset bios?
2019-02-03 11:20:28	steamport	hard reset?
2019-02-03 11:20:36	Raid	Factory restore
2019-02-03 11:20:45	steamport	here's people's success stories: https://github.com/corna/me_cleaner/issues/3

2019-02-03 11:20:56	steamport	literally just search "[mobo/PC name] bios recovery"
2019-02-03 11:21:19	steamport	it varies from pc to pc
2019-02-03 11:21:35	steamport	but again, many modern PCs have the ability to flash a firmware file from USB in the case of bad BIOS
2019-02-03 11:21:53	steamport	or if you have a dual BIOS
2019-02-03 11:21:59	steamport	well yeah
2019-02-03 11:22:01	steamport	dual bios
2019-02-03 11:22:29	Raid	@steamport https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7339271/20792448/0811c852-b7c2-11e6-8e9d-7e175ef36695.jpg that what ur talking about?
2019-02-03 11:22:31	Raid	lol
2019-02-03 11:22:42	Raid	If I get the problem just continue anyways?
2019-02-03 11:22:46	steamport	ye
2019-02-03 11:22:54	steamport	for me it doesn't require a key to continue
2019-02-03 11:23:07	steamport	pretty sure it just replaces the BIOS logo
2019-02-03 11:23:28	steamport	```On some boards the OEM firmware fails to boot without a valid Intel ME firmware; in the other cases the system should work with minor inconveniences (like longer boot times or warning messages) or without issues at all.```
2019-02-03 11:23:43	steamport	Wait, what's your CPU
2019-02-03 11:23:54	steamport	if you're lucky, you'll have a pre-gen3 ME
2019-02-03 11:24:16	steamport	(Nehalem to Broadwell has gen2 ME, pre-Nehalem is gen1)
2019-02-03 11:24:21	steamport	gen1 can be fully removed
2019-02-03 11:24:41	steamport	gen2 can be reduced from 2-7 MB to ~75 kB
2019-02-03 11:24:42	_diamondburned_	wb coffee lak?
2019-02-03 11:24:43	_diamondburned_	EDIT: wb coffee lake?
2019-02-03 11:24:50	steamport	skylake and above has gen3
2019-02-03 11:24:56	Raid	Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-6500 CPU @ 3.20GHz
2019-02-03 11:25:01	steamport	you have gen3
2019-02-03 11:25:03	steamport	```For generation 1 (before Nehalem, ME version <= 5) this tool removes the whole ME firmware and disables it completely.
2019-02-03 11:25:03	steamport	 
2019-02-03 11:25:03	steamport	For generation 2 (Nehalem-Broadwell, ME version between 6 and 10) this tool removes almost everything, leaving only the two fundamental modules needed for the correct boot, ROMP and BUP. The firmware size is reduced from 1.5 MB (non-AMT firmware) or 5 MB (AMT firmware) to ~90 kB.
2019-02-03 11:25:03	steamport	 
2019-02-03 11:25:03	steamport	For generation 3 (from Skylake onwards, ME version >= 11) the ME subsystem and the firmware structure have changed, requiring substantial changes in me_cleaner. The fundamental modules required for the correct boot are now four (rbe, kernel, syslib and bup) and the minimum firmware size is ~300 kB (from the 2 MB of the non-AMT firmware and the 7 MB of the AMT one).```
2019-02-03 11:25:04	_diamondburned_	so i'm not lucky
2019-02-03 11:25:05	_diamondburned_	ok
2019-02-03 11:25:14	steamport	i have coffee lake too
2019-02-03 11:25:25	Raid	So am I lucky or not?
2019-02-03 11:25:28	@gwu	_diamondburned_: i hope you're not still mad for yesterday
2019-02-03 11:25:35	Raid	I only need to do this once correct?
2019-02-03 11:25:40	Raid	@grimm dw he gets over it easily
2019-02-03 11:25:40	steamport	ye and flash bios
2019-02-03 11:25:51	steamport	but if you're too nervous, you can just use `-s` instead of -S`
2019-02-03 11:25:53	Raid	ye but whenever I need to update bios
2019-02-03 11:25:53	steamport	EDIT: but if you're too nervous, you can just use `-s` instead of `-S`
2019-02-03 11:25:58	_diamondburned_	mad for what
2019-02-03 11:26:02	Raid	difference?
2019-02-03 11:26:17	steamport	`-s` flips the HAP bit
2019-02-03 11:26:19	Raid	Told you @grimm lol
2019-02-03 11:26:25	steamport	and `-S` removes the un-needed partition AND flips the HAP bit
2019-02-03 11:26:44	@gwu	_diamondburned_: you got pissed because i started bullying you for little inconsistencies...
2019-02-03 11:26:46	steamport	EDIT: and `-S` removes the un-needed partitions AND flips the HAP bit
2019-02-03 11:26:49	Raid	Basically -S is the default and -s if you're a pussy
2019-02-03 11:26:51	Raid	right?
2019-02-03 11:26:53	steamport	yes
2019-02-03 11:26:55	Raid	ok
2019-02-03 11:26:58	steamport	what's your mobo

2019-02-03 11:29:41	steamport	@Raid there's successes reported for the `GA-H110M-S2H` and`GA-Z97-HD3`
2019-02-03 11:30:04	Raid	In case of a failure then?
2019-02-03 11:30:25	Raid	Keep bios backup?
2019-02-03 11:30:29	Raid	Then restore?
2019-02-03 11:30:43	steamport	lemme check
2019-02-03 11:31:13	Raid	@steamport I didn't see your response so whenever I update bios again do I need to redo?
2019-02-03 11:31:56	steamport	ye
2019-02-03 11:32:14	Raid	zzz
2019-02-03 11:32:55	Raid	Actually why tf am I even bothering with this I got windows on the other HDD so when I boot to windows its fucked eitherway
2019-02-03 11:32:55	Raid	lol
2019-02-03 11:33:31	steamport	i don't think windows will be fucked
2019-02-03 11:33:51	steamport	also bios image looks valid enough for me_cleaner. gonna make sure it has a bios recovery method
2019-02-03 11:34:51	steamport	oh nice
2019-02-03 11:34:59	steamport	@Raid no bios recovery method
2019-02-03 11:35:10	steamport	probably  shouldn't do it unless you got a bus pirate on hand or something

2019-02-03 11:36:40	Raid	yep "nice" is a good word in your context
2019-02-03 11:37:23	steamport	unless you feel like spending $15 on some gear to flash the bios externally in case of Worst Case Scenario, you shouldn't use it.
2019-02-03 11:39:10	Raid	Yeah thanks for the warning

2019-02-03 15:22:54	DewWisp	only say screenshots

2019-02-03 15:23:00	Renzix	Very important
2019-02-03 15:23:08	DewWisp	i use 4 spaces
2019-02-03 15:23:17	Renzix	Wow
2019-02-03 15:23:22	Renzix	I c
2019-02-03 15:23:26	Renzix	I'm sorry
2019-02-03 15:24:13	DewWisp	Also a prude, puritan, constantly butthurt admin who was highly reminiscent of a toddler burning ants with a magnifying glass, he'd delete messages because "it's not funny cuz i said so"
2019-02-03 15:24:42	DewWisp	Just because you don't find it funny does not mean it isn't a joke
2019-02-03 15:25:05	DewWisp	Stop delete shit that is obviously a joke to further some retarded agenda
2019-02-03 15:25:07	DewWisp	fuckass
2019-02-03 15:25:23	DewWisp	EDIT: Stop deleting shit that is obviously a joke to further some retarded agenda
2019-02-03 15:25:26	Renzix	Ok
2019-02-03 15:25:39	DewWisp	No targeting you
2019-02-03 15:25:44	DewWisp	Im just ranting
2019-02-03 15:25:50	DewWisp	He was such a bitch
2019-02-03 15:26:12	Renzix	Yea
2019-02-03 15:26:49	DewWisp	saying "kys fagit" is so obviously a fucking joke that youd have to be a braindead troglodyte not to see that
2019-02-03 15:27:07	DewWisp	"some things shouldn't be joked about" my ass
2019-02-03 15:27:15	______________________65	idk
2019-02-03 15:27:20	______________________65	I don't like that tbh

2019-02-03 15:28:02	______________________65	but I'm so scared of confrontation I'd rather leave than argue
2019-02-03 15:28:33	DewWisp	I mean same, whenever i get made fun of i either make an ass out of myself trying to retaliate or leave
2019-02-03 15:29:14	______________________65	the sort of casual homophobia that's common in especially technology centered communities
2019-02-03 15:29:14	Renzix	K
2019-02-03 15:29:26	______________________65	I try not to be bothered by it but it's always there
2019-02-03 15:29:30	______________________65	so I tend to leave it alone
2019-02-03 15:29:54	______________________65	I am but one fool, how could I possibly change something like that
2019-02-03 15:29:57	DewWisp	I can understand that, i really shouldn't say "that's gay" so much but it's almost a part of me at this point
2019-02-03 15:30:04	______________________65	I get that
2019-02-03 15:30:14	______________________65	I say "that's straight" a lot
2019-02-03 15:30:29	______________________65	it's reflex at this point, but it started as a forced joke
2019-02-03 15:30:53	DewWisp	I don't claim to be a saint, I'm honestly a terrible person if I really think about it.
2019-02-03 15:31:04	DewWisp	But
2019-02-03 15:31:13	DewWisp	There are people far worse than I am
2019-02-03 15:31:16	______________________65	I'm alright I guess
2019-02-03 15:31:31	______________________65	very few people are really bad
2019-02-03 15:31:39	DewWisp	For every scum there is, there is an even worse scum
2019-02-03 15:31:55	______________________65	being incorrect doesn't make you bad, not knowing something doesn't make you bad
2019-02-03 15:32:07	DewWisp	No I know that
2019-02-03 15:32:08	DewWisp	But
2019-02-03 15:32:25	Renzix	If your not good
2019-02-03 15:32:27	Renzix	You are bad
2019-02-03 15:32:31	Renzix	By definition
2019-02-03 15:32:35	______________________65	even doing bad things doesn't make you bad, it's doing them and not even feeling a smidge of guilt for it that makes you bad
2019-02-03 15:32:44	Renzix	I feel that people who do nothing are bad uwu
2019-02-03 15:32:48	DewWisp	I'm a self-centered, apathetic, cynical sadist and care only for myself by getting pleasure from others pain
2019-02-03 15:32:54	______________________65	hmm
2019-02-03 15:33:17	______________________65	seems like you want to justify not changing your behavior because you don't want to go through the effort of being more considerate
2019-02-03 15:33:23	______________________65	I was like that once
2019-02-03 15:33:33	______________________65	it's exhausting
2019-02-03 15:33:47	DewWisp	My basic guideline is, all humans are terrible intrinsically, however, some humans are worst than the rest
2019-02-03 15:33:58	______________________65	seems dumb
2019-02-03 15:34:07	Renzix	Define worse
2019-02-03 15:34:19	______________________65	by what measurement are people bad and who decides
2019-02-03 15:34:29	______________________65	is it all subjective or is there a higher power
2019-02-03 15:34:30	DewWisp	good point
2019-02-03 15:34:38	@gwu	https://ptpb.pw/4EyF.png
2019-02-03 15:34:41	DewWisp	morality is mutual agreement
2019-02-03 15:34:47	@gwu	who is called `__________________________65`?
2019-02-03 15:35:05	Renzix	No morals are argued alot...
2019-02-03 15:35:32	______________________65	personally I'm a religious type but I'm not a fan of the afterlife idea so morality is still eh
2019-02-03 15:35:37	DewWisp	My religion teacher brought up the argument that you cannot have morality without a god which I think is incredibly stupid
2019-02-03 15:36:10	______________________65	moralism is a plague
2019-02-03 15:36:17	DewWisp	because you can't have universal morality anyways
2019-02-03 15:36:21	______________________65	to paraphrase Emma Goldman
2019-02-03 15:36:24	Renzix	O person named @אַש (random Unicode)
2019-02-03 15:36:25	DewWisp	all universal morality is mutual agreement between people
2019-02-03 15:36:50	Renzix	EDIT: O person named @אַש (random Unicode for DiScOrD name)
2019-02-03 15:36:55	Renzix	No
2019-02-03 15:37:04	DewWisp	universal morality provided by a God is just mutual agreement between people who believe in said God
2019-02-03 15:37:05	Renzix	Abortion is a easy example
2019-02-03 15:37:13	______________________65	morality is a concept constructed around an order in which we already live, not something that guides that order
2019-02-03 15:37:13	Renzix	Is abortion morally right?
2019-02-03 15:37:17	______________________65	it's the other way around
2019-02-03 15:37:26	______________________65	the order changes and guides morality
2019-02-03 15:37:38	DewWisp	if you cannot prove the existence of God and cannot disprove the existence of God then the universal morality provided by a God is just mutual agreement
2019-02-03 15:37:49	Renzix	Really
2019-02-03 15:37:55	Renzix	You can't disprove I'm batmam
2019-02-03 15:37:59	Renzix	EDIT: You can't disprove I'm batman
2019-02-03 15:38:06	______________________65	it's absolutely just a conservative (in the intellectual sense) case of foolishness
2019-02-03 15:38:07	Renzix	That means it's true
2019-02-03 15:38:17	DewWisp	Okay
2019-02-03 15:38:25	DewWisp	What proof is there of a god?
2019-02-03 15:38:31	DewWisp	What proof isnt there?
2019-02-03 15:38:44	______________________65	lmao this is some intro to theology shit
2019-02-03 15:38:48	Renzix	It's not proof if it grasping at straws
2019-02-03 15:38:59	______________________65	that then which nothing greater can be thought
2019-02-03 15:39:03	Renzix	Believe a god if you want to believe in it
2019-02-03 15:39:06	______________________65	something something Anselm
2019-02-03 15:39:08	Renzix	Don't if you dont
2019-02-03 15:39:14	DewWisp	I choose not to believe because I think reality is a concept for a long bygone era
2019-02-03 15:39:18	______________________65	uhhhhhh neoplatonism
2019-02-03 15:39:21	DewWisp	religion*
2019-02-03 15:39:34	DewWisp	not reality lol
2019-02-03 15:39:39	______________________65	what's another pointless buzzword in that argument
2019-02-03 15:40:05	Renzix	Also people seem to think we are much smarter than 100 years ago
2019-02-03 15:40:10	Renzix	In some ways we are
2019-02-03 15:40:15	Renzix	But in some ways we arwnt
2019-02-03 15:40:21	DewWisp	indeed
2019-02-03 15:40:27	______________________65	seriously just read Anselm, it's been over half a fucking millennia and the arguments haven't changed at all
2019-02-03 15:40:32	______________________65	and make just as little sense
2019-02-03 15:41:05	DewWisp	honestly how do we go from the concept of not everything can be funny to whether or not a God exists
2019-02-03 15:41:28	______________________65	idk intro to philosophy sounding ass people like you tend to do that
2019-02-03 15:41:36	______________________65	good old intellectual escalatio
2019-02-03 15:42:03	DewWisp	Sorry, probably my adhd, didn't take my medication this morning by accident
2019-02-03 15:42:07	Renzix	When u explain good or bad it raises the question who decides
2019-02-03 15:42:24	DewWisp	no one decides, its mutual agreement
2019-02-03 15:42:35	DewWisp	its bad because we said so
2019-02-03 15:42:35	Renzix	Arguably correct uwu
2019-02-03 15:42:53	Renzix	1984 is a book
2019-02-03 15:43:00	DewWisp	i read it
2019-02-03 15:43:05	DewWisp	my favorite book actually
2019-02-03 15:43:08	______________________65	people have a universal set of social principles that became what we call "basic morality"
2019-02-03 15:43:12	Renzix	Yea
2019-02-03 15:43:20	Renzix	So you believe they are right?

2019-02-03 15:43:40	DewWisp	is killing really bad? how can you justify this?

2019-02-03 15:44:19	DewWisp	idr
2019-02-03 15:44:26	______________________65	I mean I'd say killing is bad because people feel bad when they do it
2019-02-03 15:44:46	______________________65	and in general it's hard to get someone to kill someone else without conditioning them to do so beforehand
2019-02-03 15:44:57	DewWisp	I dont feel bad when I make fun of someone, i feel good about it most of the time
2019-02-03 15:45:06	______________________65	you've been conditioned to

2019-02-03 21:54:26	Raid	If you can't install arch then why bother
2019-02-03 21:54:44	Raid	@davidv7 He literally says the command out loud and all u have to do is copy
2019-02-03 21:54:46	davidv7	maintaining it isnt hard
2019-02-03 21:55:02	davidv7	yeah but telling you what to write != why to write it
2019-02-03 21:55:34	davidv7	some people retain information better that way
2019-02-03 21:55:37	xent	he explains a lot of it
2019-02-03 21:55:42	davidv7	@xent so yeah maybe that helps
2019-02-03 21:55:51	xent	yeah i watched it already
2019-02-03 21:56:02	xent	and bear send me a cool pastebin guide
2019-02-03 21:56:13	xent	with comments on every command explaining what it does
2019-02-03 21:56:46	Raid	bear did?
2019-02-03 21:56:54	lidl_papi	@xent try to install it in a vm first
2019-02-03 21:56:56	xent	like lukes video but ok paper
2019-02-03 21:57:00	Raid	that's quite surprising
2019-02-03 21:57:05	xent	it's too late now to install on a vm
2019-02-03 21:57:13	lidl_papi	why
2019-02-03 21:57:20	Raid	@xent Tell me what the problem is
2019-02-03 21:57:24	xent	wiped drive already
2019-02-03 21:57:40	Raid	Why don't you tell us the problem instead of "I think I fucked up"
2019-02-03 21:57:46	xent	raid i've said this like 10 times i didn't know what went wrong
2019-02-03 21:57:58	xent	anyway
2019-02-03 21:58:04	lidl_papi	what was the last command you typed in then

2019-02-03 21:58:16	xent	new day new me
2019-02-03 21:58:32	Raid	Lmao this guy
2019-02-03 21:59:06	Raid	Maybe the problem was the setup was not for EFI
2019-02-03 21:59:07	lidl_papi	@xent did you try to chroot into the installation? you can do that from the arch installation disk
2019-02-03 21:59:30	lidl_papi	EDIT: @xent did you try to chroot into the installed system? you can do that from the arch installation disk
2019-02-03 21:59:45	xent	i did that at one point
2019-02-03 21:59:46	Raid	Use GTP table if you have  UEFI
2019-02-03 21:59:55	xent	oh wait
2019-02-03 22:00:04	lidl_papi	you can do it again
2019-02-03 22:00:14	lidl_papi	and fix the issue instead of starting over
2019-02-03 22:00:27	xent	oh no i wiped my partitions to start over the install already

2019-02-03 22:01:28	lidl_papi	at least he makes the effort, he'll get there

2019-02-03 22:01:47	Raid	He's not fixing the problem
2019-02-03 22:01:48	xent	let's get this BREAD
2019-02-03 22:01:53	lidl_papi	he tried to install it 3 times
2019-02-03 22:01:54	Raid	He's just restarting like a dumb ass
2019-02-03 22:02:19	Raid	Exactly tried to install did he fix his problem during the installation?
2019-02-03 22:02:22	Raid	You learn more that way
2019-02-03 22:02:25	xent	that's easier for me if i don't know what the fucking problem is lol
2019-02-03 22:02:26	Raid	instead of copying and pasting command
2019-02-03 22:02:39	Raid	Then figure it out?
2019-02-03 22:02:40	Raid	wtf
2019-02-03 22:02:59	xent	i was trying to fix it for 3 hours last night
2019-02-03 22:03:13	Raid	Fixing what if you don't know the problem ...

2019-02-03 23:57:30	@gwu	an arch install isn't comfortable.
2019-02-03 23:57:48	@gwu	unlike most installers which do the work for you
2019-02-03 23:58:04	@gwu	you have to do a little bit for an arch install to go smoothly
2019-02-03 23:58:27	@gwu	therefor, even if it's for a short time, you see how a linux system is built
2019-02-03 23:58:43	@gwu	even if pacstrap, etc abstract most of it away from you.
2019-02-03 23:59:18	@gwu	it's a step to understand the tool we use everyday
2019-02-03 23:59:36	Renzix	K

2019-02-04 00:00:57	@gwu	you coming along asking some kid what a partition table is is retarded.
2019-02-04 00:01:17	@gwu	not only because many filesystems can perfectly go without one

2019-02-04 00:03:30	Renzix	Dunno just delete stuff
2019-02-04 00:04:11	Renzix	Maybe I should make a script that says how many packages a thingy requires

2019-02-04 01:42:06	Banbeucmas	I did do some really low unprofessional art so idk how hell is it to do pixel art on PS
2019-02-04 01:42:08	xent	ugh ok
2019-02-04 01:42:19	qutebrowser_	Paint.net lacks features tbh
2019-02-04 01:42:33	Banbeucmas	@qutebrowser It is but it is less confusing than PS for starters
2019-02-04 01:42:37	Bowling_Ball_Boy	color schemes are shit in photoshop, and pixel art is overall not enjoyable
2019-02-04 01:42:48	Bowling_Ball_Boy	in my opinion
2019-02-04 01:42:50	Banbeucmas	@Bowling_Ball_Boy Gonna note that, thanks
2019-02-04 01:42:51	Bowling_Ball_Boy	some people might like it tho

2019-02-04 01:43:39	qutebrowser_	Don't think so
2019-02-04 01:43:40	Banbeucmas	Anyway @Bowling_Ball_Boy You can dual boot or make a Windows Virtual Machine when you go full Linux
2019-02-04 01:43:44	qutebrowser_	U have to manually install
2019-02-04 01:43:54	Bowling_Ball_Boy	what would be the performance on games tho
2019-02-04 01:43:56	qutebrowser_	Is yay on Aur?
2019-02-04 01:43:59	Banbeucmas	For ricing. Gnome mostly use shell to decorate :3
2019-02-04 01:44:04	Banbeucmas	@qutebrowser Yay is on AUR
2019-02-04 01:44:12	Banbeucmas	But yeah you have to install manually
2019-02-04 01:44:15	qutebrowser_	Use Aur or use install instructions on yay
2019-02-04 01:44:24	Banbeucmas	Just use the install instructions
2019-02-04 01:44:24	qutebrowser_	Same thing overall
2019-02-04 01:44:28	Banbeucmas	That was what i did

2019-02-04 01:44:37	Bear	It’s as easy as that.
2019-02-04 01:44:40	xent	ok
2019-02-04 01:45:02	Banbeucmas	```bash
2019-02-04 01:45:02	Banbeucmas	#!/bin/sh
2019-02-04 01:45:02	Banbeucmas	 
2019-02-04 01:45:02	Banbeucmas	git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
2019-02-04 01:45:02	Banbeucmas	cd yay
2019-02-04 01:45:02	Banbeucmas	makepkg -si
2019-02-04 01:45:02	Banbeucmas	```
2019-02-04 01:45:11	Banbeucmas	Or just copy this, chmod +x and then execute lol
2019-02-04 01:45:25	qutebrowser_	Reeee it's not hard
2019-02-04 01:45:30	Banbeucmas	@qutebrowser I know
2019-02-04 01:45:30	qutebrowser_	Just run the commands
2019-02-04 01:46:17	Banbeucmas	@Bowling_Ball_Boy Depends
2019-02-04 01:46:19	xent	i know
2019-02-04 01:46:53	Bowling_Ball_Boy	why does every graphic design software's interface look like shit
2019-02-04 01:47:08	lidl_papi	gimp is gud
2019-02-04 01:47:14	Banbeucmas	@Bowling_Ball_Boy I haven't try PS in VM tbf
2019-02-04 01:47:18	qutebrowser_	I like PS interface
2019-02-04 01:47:26	Bowling_Ball_Boy	photoshop is tolerable
2019-02-04 01:47:31	Banbeucmas	That is why I dual boot
2019-02-04 01:47:35	Banbeucmas	It is a nice program tho
2019-02-04 01:47:39	lidl_papi	gimp is great if you use the search(/) feature
2019-02-04 01:47:41	qutebrowser_	Gimp 2 is lacking, but still tolerable
2019-02-04 01:47:51	qutebrowser_	It's dark now at least
2019-02-04 01:48:02	Banbeucmas	First time using GIMP. It was really confusing tbh
2019-02-04 01:48:09	Banbeucmas	Layer pasting is still uhhhh
2019-02-04 01:48:21	Banbeucmas	But I mean after a while it is fine
2019-02-04 01:48:24	qutebrowser_	Kek yea and gimp lacks conveniences like ps
2019-02-04 01:48:31	Banbeucmas	Just how it's handle layers
2019-02-04 01:48:34	lidl_papi	this meme was made by gimp 😎
2019-02-04 01:48:34	lidl_papi	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/361910177961738244/541676385060651009/SPOILER_templeos.jpg
2019-02-04 01:48:53	Banbeucmas	Even with PS it at least doesn't that confusing
2019-02-04 01:49:16	Banbeucmas	I don't say anything with PAINT.NET
2019-02-04 01:49:16	Banbeucmas	It was the easiest to get a hang with
2019-02-04 01:49:30	qutebrowser_	Ps is more convenient, it's just the gimps devs refuse to do the same
2019-02-04 01:49:47	Banbeucmas	For some people at least. Like pasting image it does overwrites the current layers
2019-02-04 01:50:00	Banbeucmas	PS creates a new layer on top if I remember
2019-02-04 01:50:15	qutebrowser_	Ps doesn't have layer boundaries also
2019-02-04 01:50:17	Banbeucmas	Gimp is uhhh.... you need to anchor the layer I guess
2019-02-04 01:50:40	Banbeucmas	Took me a while to know that I have to Anchor the layers for more stuff to be thrown
2019-02-04 01:50:46	Banbeucmas	Which was really confusing at the time
2019-02-04 01:50:52	lidl_papi	graphics design is hacky tbqh
2019-02-04 01:51:04	qutebrowser_	Not Ps, Ps is paint basically
2019-02-04 01:51:53	xent	is kitty a terminal
2019-02-04 01:51:56	qutebrowser_	Yes
2019-02-04 01:51:57	xent	or a shell
2019-02-04 01:51:59	xent	ok
2019-02-04 01:52:02	qutebrowser_	Terminal emulator
2019-02-04 01:52:03	xent	is qt a shell
2019-02-04 01:52:08	Banbeucmas	No
2019-02-04 01:52:12	qutebrowser_	No qt is graphics
2019-02-04 01:52:14	Renzix	QT is a gui tookit
2019-02-04 01:52:14	xent	wtf
2019-02-04 01:52:24	Banbeucmas	QT is kinda a GUI Interface
2019-02-04 01:52:28	Banbeucmas	Same with GTK btw
2019-02-04 01:52:29	qutebrowser_	Qt and gtk are similar
2019-02-04 01:52:32	xent	o yeah
2019-02-04 01:52:38	xent	whats a good shell
2019-02-04 01:52:41	Banbeucmas	zsh
2019-02-04 01:52:43	xent	zsh?
2019-02-04 01:52:44	xent	ok
2019-02-04 01:52:55	qutebrowser_	Fish if ur lazy and hate having features and like weird syntax
2019-02-04 01:52:56	Banbeucmas	Some people like bash or sh but that is opinions
2019-02-04 01:53:16	Banbeucmas	I haven't try fish so I cannot comment on anything with it
2019-02-04 01:53:21	Banbeucmas	I do saw some people use it tho
2019-02-04 01:53:25	qutebrowser_	Fish just has weird syntax that's all
2019-02-04 01:53:37	qutebrowser_	It's just brainlet simple
2019-02-04 01:53:38	Banbeucmas	@qutebrowser That just contradict what you have said btw

2019-02-04 01:54:45	Banbeucmas	Ah you got "and"
2019-02-04 01:54:47	qutebrowser_	Yea, weird syntax != Bad
2019-02-04 01:54:58	Banbeucmas	I guess I didn't get your sentence right
2019-02-04 01:55:02	qutebrowser_	Rip
2019-02-04 01:55:17	Stve	@Banbeucmas it actually got &&

2019-02-04 01:55:42	Stve	in addition to `; and`
2019-02-04 01:55:47	Stve	is pretty new
2019-02-04 01:56:01	qutebrowser_	It's nice if you can't be bothered with new plugins tbh
2019-02-04 01:56:15	qutebrowser_	But other than that eh there's not much to it
2019-02-04 01:56:39	Bear	Fish is gay.

2019-02-04 01:56:56	Banbeucmas	EDIT: Nice way to spell zsh btw
2019-02-04 01:57:01	Bear	I haven’t messed with zsh.

2019-02-04 01:57:34	Bear	I have no complaints from bash.
2019-02-04 01:57:37	Bear	It’s a mans shell.
2019-02-04 01:57:46	qutebrowser_	It's also a slower shell
2019-02-04 01:57:55	qutebrowser_	And an older shell
2019-02-04 01:57:56	Bear	Sounds like you’re gay.

2019-02-04 02:21:08	Banbeucmas	@Turquoise Not the thing I want to use. The problem is that having variables so people can swap for later use

2019-02-04 04:02:07	Banbeucmas	I think it is because your color scheme then
2019-02-04 04:02:49	ym555	uwu
2019-02-04 04:02:56	Turquoise	mhh
2019-02-04 04:03:09	Turquoise	i think it's related to the fact that single monocle sets the layout to monocle now
2019-02-04 04:03:20	Turquoise	while it kept it as tiled before
2019-02-04 04:03:30	Turquoise	and you probably can't show presels on monocle windows
2019-02-04 04:03:45	Turquoise	just like you can't with fullscreen windows
2019-02-04 04:03:58	lidl_papi	@Turquoise u ever ate cheese with just onions?
2019-02-04 04:04:07	Turquoise	i don't think so
2019-02-04 04:04:10	lidl_papi	try it
2019-02-04 04:04:15	Turquoise	why though
2019-02-04 04:04:24	lidl_papi	it's good
2019-02-04 04:05:04	ym555	>and you probably can't show presels on monocle windows
2019-02-04 04:05:04	ym555	yeah in real monocle mode you can't
2019-02-04 04:05:16	ym555	but with single_monocole you can
2019-02-04 04:05:22	ym555	at least in 0.9.5
2019-02-04 04:05:30	Turquoise	it's not like presels are very useful when there is only a single window tbh
2019-02-04 04:05:38	ym555	yea true
2019-02-04 04:05:57	Turquoise	i mostly use them to pinpoint a target

2019-02-04 05:53:57	Raid	Hate it but still uses it anyways

2019-02-04 05:54:52	panther5482	and yeah i think alsa kind of sucks, a little disappointed whenever I see it installed by default

2019-02-04 05:56:05	Raid	try it yourself if it stops working for you or you don't like it then use other alternatives
2019-02-04 05:56:21	Raid	I always try things first before actually making the decision

2019-02-04 07:17:28	_diamondburned_	it's probably one of the easiest thing you could ever do with the language

2019-02-04 07:53:15	Turquoise	those are cute too
2019-02-04 07:53:15	_diamondburned_	eg I have some guy ranking 12402

2019-02-04 07:53:24	@gwu	yeah, maps are great
2019-02-04 07:53:25	_diamondburned_	what i do, I would throw that into array index

2019-02-04 07:58:29	@gwu	i think all the actual scripts are posix...
2019-02-04 07:58:29	Turquoise	since the package manager depends on it

2019-02-04 07:59:49	Turquoise	gentoo has use flags and more packages
2019-02-04 08:00:01	Turquoise	crux has simpler packaging and bsd style init
2019-02-04 08:00:08	_diamondburned_	but logo
2019-02-04 08:00:10	Turquoise	so minor pros and cons
2019-02-04 08:00:20	_diamondburned_	crux's logo reflects your state of mind
2019-02-04 08:00:21	Turquoise	yeah the crux logo fucking sucks lmao

2019-02-04 08:00:59	Turquoise

2019-02-04 09:42:31	_diamondburned_	eg global keybinds
2019-02-04 09:42:43	Sacul	i'd cover tview by now and later other libs

2019-02-04 09:50:09	Bowling_Ball_Boy	could i rice a distro in a vm and then make it my main os
2019-02-04 09:50:29	IgnisCyan	I don’t think that’s possible?
2019-02-04 09:50:33	_diamondburned_	it should be
2019-02-04 09:50:34	IgnisCyan	You could make the job easier
2019-02-04 09:50:41	IgnisCyan	By saving dotfiles and stuff
2019-02-04 09:50:42	_diamondburned_	do that stuff, then write it to an img
2019-02-04 09:50:48	_diamondburned_	use clonezilla then override
2019-02-04 09:50:49	IgnisCyan	Oh huh
2019-02-04 09:50:50	_diamondburned_	or that, dotfiles
2019-02-04 09:50:54	Bowling_Ball_Boy	i uh
2019-02-04 09:50:54	_diamondburned_	a much better idea
2019-02-04 09:50:58	Bowling_Ball_Boy	im not very tech savvy
2019-02-04 09:51:07	Bowling_Ball_Boy	im jsut triyng to test it out before i switch from windows
2019-02-04 09:51:12	_diamondburned_	live USB
2019-02-04 09:51:17	_diamondburned_	plug it in, boot in
2019-02-04 09:51:17	_diamondburned_	done
2019-02-04 09:51:27	IgnisCyan	I’m telling you from experience, don’t try to rice until you understand Linux a bit
2019-02-04 09:51:38	IgnisCyan	I am struggling a lot
2019-02-04 09:51:39	_diamondburned_	you can't understand Linux without trying it

2019-02-04 09:51:45	Bowling_Ball_Boy	I've used linux before for 2 years
2019-02-04 09:51:55	Bowling_Ball_Boy	it was ubuntu on a chromebook
2019-02-04 09:51:56	_diamondburned_	what Linux specifically?
2019-02-04 09:51:57	_diamondburned_	oh kek
2019-02-04 09:51:58	IgnisCyan	I mean jumping in completely blind
2019-02-04 09:52:00	Bowling_Ball_Boy	well
2019-02-04 09:52:03	Bowling_Ball_Boy	idk if it was ubuntu
2019-02-04 09:52:07	lidl_papi	check me now
2019-02-04 09:52:09	Bowling_Ball_Boy	I was 7 at the time
2019-02-04 09:52:10	@gwu	_diamondburned_: stop using sixel, nearly no term supports it. use framebuffer or ueberzug
2019-02-04 09:52:14	Bowling_Ball_Boy	it had kfce
2019-02-04 09:52:17	_diamondburned_	no I on't
2019-02-04 09:52:19	_diamondburned_	EDIT: no I won't
2019-02-04 09:52:32	_diamondburned_	the fact that no term supports it isn't my problem
2019-02-04 09:52:35	@gwu	and if you don't like ueberzug, then rewrite something else to use child windows
2019-02-04 09:52:40	_diamondburned_	nope
2019-02-04 09:52:45	_diamondburned_	not until it's crossplatform
2019-02-04 09:53:04	@gwu	sixel is the least crossplatform thing i could think of
2019-02-04 09:53:05	_diamondburned_	SteamOS is a proper role?
2019-02-04 09:53:06	_diamondburned_	w0t
2019-02-04 09:53:08	_diamondburned_	really?
2019-02-04 09:53:13	_diamondburned_	let me just use framebuffers on Windows
2019-02-04 09:53:14	lidl_papi	yes
2019-02-04 09:53:18	_diamondburned_	let me just use X on Windows
2019-02-04 09:53:20	_diamondburned_	mlterm? fuck's taht
2019-02-04 09:53:22	_diamondburned_	it doesn't exist
2019-02-04 09:53:24	lidl_papi	check my profile for list of available roles
2019-02-04 09:53:27	@gwu	it isn't even supported on the one platform you're using
2019-02-04 09:53:37	_diamondburned_	sixel? used in various physical terminals and virtual terminal emulators?
2019-02-04 09:53:38	_diamondburned_	fuck that
2019-02-04 09:53:42	_diamondburned_	gonna do framebuffer
2019-02-04 09:53:57	@gwu	there should be libraries for this stuff
2019-02-04 09:54:05	_diamondburned_	but there's none
2019-02-04 09:54:07	_diamondburned_	deal with it
2019-02-04 09:54:13	_diamondburned_	the only thing remotely close is libsixel
2019-02-04 09:54:20	Renzix	wait for what
2019-02-04 09:54:24	@gwu	images
2019-02-04 09:54:29	Renzix	i c
2019-02-04 09:54:42	Bowling_Ball_Boy	they didnt perform sweet victory at the half time show im gonna kill the pope
2019-02-04 09:54:45	@gwu	but there are like 3 terms that support it well
2019-02-04 09:54:48	Renzix	Images r baot
2019-02-04 09:54:50	Renzix	EDIT: Images r blaot

2019-02-04 09:55:07	@gwu	and diamond is talking about "cross-platform"
2019-02-04 09:55:10	_diamondburned_	yup
2019-02-04 09:55:17	_diamondburned_	mlterm
2019-02-04 09:55:19	Renzix	Sounds awful
2019-02-04 09:55:20	_diamondburned_	🤷
2019-02-04 09:55:26	_diamondburned_	but being gwimm
2019-02-04 09:55:30	_diamondburned_	of course mlterm is linux only
2019-02-04 09:55:32	_diamondburned_	for whatever reason
2019-02-04 09:55:37	_diamondburned_	i can't comprehend
2019-02-04 09:55:39	Renzix	hey i got a idea
2019-02-04 09:55:42	_diamondburned_	arguing with him is a bother
2019-02-04 09:55:45	Renzix	emacs can display images
2019-02-04 09:55:48	_diamondburned_	ren pls
2019-02-04 09:55:49	@gwu	xD
2019-02-04 09:55:51	Renzix	XD
2019-02-04 09:56:00	@gwu	emacs os
2019-02-04 09:56:25	@gwu	you can "boot into" emacs right?
2019-02-04 09:56:37	lidl_papi	@buyBread
2019-02-04 09:56:41	Renzix	What would you mean by that
2019-02-04 09:56:43	@gwu	you can use the kernel to do nothing but start emacs
2019-02-04 09:56:56	Renzix	possibly i never did it
2019-02-04 09:56:59	@gwu	and emacs is your distro then, basically
2019-02-04 09:57:18	Renzix	but really you probably want to start bash first
2019-02-04 09:57:21	@gwu	the emacs guys are fucking insane
2019-02-04 09:57:25	Renzix	and have a init system
2019-02-04 09:57:30	@gwu	why?
2019-02-04 09:57:35	Renzix	if emacs crashes
2019-02-04 09:57:35	@gwu	you have emacs, renzix
2019-02-04 09:57:38	Renzix	rip
2019-02-04 09:57:44	@gwu	emacs doesn't crash
2019-02-04 09:58:02	Renzix	plus alot of emacs is single cored including some major features
2019-02-04 09:58:09	@gwu	emacs does what netflix does with its servers to test them with you
2019-02-04 09:58:19	Renzix	so if someone does something rarted and you use it
2019-02-04 09:58:23	Renzix	it hangs
2019-02-04 09:58:29	@gwu	oh nice
2019-02-04 09:58:35	@gwu	get better cpu
2019-02-04 09:58:43	@gwu	so you can handle **emacs**
2019-02-04 09:59:34	Renzix	cpu doesnt make a difference
2019-02-04 09:59:58	Renzix	if someone writes bad code it might hang your entire emacs
2019-02-04 10:07:38	_diamondburned_	I'll be honest
2019-02-04 10:07:56	_diamondburned_	I was about to implement w3m
2019-02-04 10:07:56	_diamondburned_	Guess not
2019-02-04 10:08:19	Renzix	Doesnt neofetch use w3m?
2019-02-04 10:08:32	Renzix	could you ask dylan how he did it or just look at source?

2019-02-04 13:54:19	@gwu	if you want to work with bash functions it gets a bit annoying to do a lot of `$()` and `x=""`
2019-02-04 13:57:09	_diamondburned_	no because | read is inside a pipe
2019-02-04 13:57:18	_diamondburned_	so the variables declared there are not applied
2019-02-04 13:57:20	_diamondburned_	you could do this tho

2019-02-04 14:41:31	_diamondburned_	@tdeo will Voice implement/integrate with your router? or will it be independent

2019-02-04 14:43:27	_diamondburned_	you could join the thing, but the router isn't self-hosted
2019-02-04 14:43:35	_diamondburned_	how is an IRC client going to listen to the mic?
2019-02-04 14:43:44	@gwu	`/dev/`
2019-02-04 14:43:45	tdeo	it's designed to be multiuser
2019-02-04 14:43:51	_diamondburned_	/dev/ wat
2019-02-04 14:43:56	_diamondburned_	you're not making your own IRC client
2019-02-04 14:43:59	_diamondburned_	how is /dev/ gonna help
2019-02-04 14:44:16	@gwu	any input device comes in over dev
2019-02-04 14:44:37	_diamondburned_	yeah, and how do you listen to /dev/
2019-02-04 14:44:39	@gwu	you can mpv your connected cameras and it'll show
2019-02-04 14:44:52	_diamondburned_	>how do you listen to /dev/
2019-02-04 14:44:58	_diamondburned_	>the router isn't self-hosted
2019-02-04 14:45:00	Jake_Moon	/Dev/wat what?
2019-02-04 14:45:04	Jake_Moon	What's wat?
2019-02-04 14:45:13	Banbeucmas	wat?
2019-02-04 14:45:20	Jake_Moon	What?
2019-02-04 14:45:20	@gwu	aplay on the mic, and it'll play your mic input
2019-02-04 14:45:28	_diamondburned_	yeah, but irc clients can't run aplay
2019-02-04 14:45:29	Jake_Moon	You mean apply?
2019-02-04 14:45:30	Banbeucmas	wat do you mean wat is wat?
2019-02-04 14:45:30	_diamondburned_	can they?
2019-02-04 14:45:37	@gwu	it's just a pipe
2019-02-04 14:45:42	@gwu	just read it like a file
2019-02-04 14:45:45	reed	he's retarded. ignore him @Banbeucmas

2019-02-04 14:49:25	@gwu	+ there's surely libs that handle audio for you
2019-02-04 14:49:26	tdeo	yeah i'm still probably gonna use the electron client after this
2019-02-04 14:49:36	_diamondburned_	gwimm
2019-02-04 14:49:38	_diamondburned_	that's not the issue
2019-02-04 14:49:43	@gwu	oh
2019-02-04 14:49:44	_diamondburned_	the issue is the router's probably not going to be self-hosted
2019-02-04 14:49:50	@gwu	oh
2019-02-04 14:49:52	tdeo	in most cases it is
2019-02-04 14:49:54	_diamondburned_	the only interaction you would likely have is the IRC client only
2019-02-04 14:49:55	@gwu	yeah
2019-02-04 14:49:56	_diamondburned_	well I won't
2019-02-04 14:49:59	@gwu	why wouldn't it be
2019-02-04 14:50:00	tdeo	but it's not designed to be self hosted
2019-02-04 14:50:05	@gwu	you won't
2019-02-04 14:50:05	_diamondburned_	I refuse to self host anything due to my laziness
2019-02-04 14:50:06	tdeo	it's designed to be multi user
2019-02-04 14:50:07	_diamondburned_	because it has multi-user
2019-02-04 14:50:19	@gwu	i self-host bitlbee
2019-02-04 14:50:22	@gwu	most people do
2019-02-04 14:50:25	_diamondburned_	but this isn't bitlbee
2019-02-04 14:50:25	_diamondburned_	kek

2019-02-04 14:50:33	_diamondburned_	>most people do
2019-02-04 14:50:33	_diamondburned_	 
2019-02-04 14:50:33	_diamondburned_	exactly why it's not popular yet
2019-02-04 14:50:34	@gwu	it's like bitlbee
2019-02-04 14:50:40	_diamondburned_	no it's not exactly like it
2019-02-04 14:50:41	tdeo	i hosted bitlbee
2019-02-04 14:50:42	tdeo	on my server
2019-02-04 14:50:47	tdeo	which has no audio
2019-02-04 14:50:49	@gwu	"yet" i hope it never becomes popular
2019-02-04 14:50:58	_diamondburned_	the point of tdeo's
2019-02-04 14:51:04	_diamondburned_	is that you could host this anywhere
2019-02-04 14:51:08	_diamondburned_	and it wouldn't be user-agnostic
2019-02-04 14:51:14	_diamondburned_	meaning you could use it to route whatever Discord account
2019-02-04 14:51:16	@gwu	alright
2019-02-04 14:51:26	_diamondburned_	and it would only belong to your current IRC session
2019-02-04 14:51:32	tdeo	yeah that's just a side effect of how i'm doing it, it's not really that important
2019-02-04 14:51:35	tdeo	makes for nicer code tho
2019-02-04 14:51:39	_diamondburned_	~~tbh isn't pasting the token everywhere kinda a security risk or something but whatever~~
2019-02-04 14:51:57	tdeo	it's a security risk right now if it's remote because it doesn't have ssl yet
2019-02-04 14:52:01	@gwu	i didn't use the token to make bitlbee connect.
2019-02-04 14:52:09	_diamondburned_	welp, sucks to be you
2019-02-04 14:52:12	_diamondburned_	that's uber bannable
2019-02-04 14:52:15	@gwu	it used my login credentials
2019-02-04 14:52:22	@gwu	yeet
2019-02-04 14:52:27	_diamondburned_	it's written all over every API that using the /login endpoint will get you banned
2019-02-04 14:52:36	_diamondburned_	lemme get dgo's
2019-02-04 14:52:55	@gwu	if i get banned better for me

2019-02-04 14:52:59	_diamondburned_	k
2019-02-04 14:53:05	@gwu	then i'm forced to stop using this trash app
2019-02-04 14:53:09	_diamondburned_	mk
2019-02-04 14:53:26	tdeo	i wanted to test my server with polari

2019-02-04 14:53:36	tdeo	with regular servers
2019-02-04 14:53:57	_diamondburned_	how does IRC SSL work btw
2019-02-04 14:54:01	_diamondburned_	is it just like HTTP?
2019-02-04 14:54:06	tdeo	yeah, think so
2019-02-04 14:54:06	_diamondburned_	where you make a LE/whatever SSL cert
2019-02-04 14:54:07	_diamondburned_	o
2019-02-04 14:54:17	_diamondburned_	does the current server lib support it?

2019-02-04 15:16:53	@gwu	audio has not much to do with x11
2019-02-04 15:17:42	Banbeucmas	Ok
2019-02-04 15:17:48	@gwu	i don't think it does much video

2019-02-04 21:05:00	OTheB	Easy exercise: Look at every package in some distro's repos and look at the uncompressed size of them all. If the median is pretty small, then probably smart to use an algorithm that's good with smaller files, else, lrzip if you're seeing big packages

2019-02-04 22:24:27	Renzix	What's pluperfect tense?
2019-02-04 22:24:27	OTheB	That's still tense
2019-02-04 22:24:39	OTheB	Using a whole word in place of affixation is called "periphrasis"
2019-02-04 22:25:19	Turquoise	latin is really neat
2019-02-04 22:25:20	OTheB	Pluperfect tense isn't a tense. It's a combination of the past tense and perfect aspect
2019-02-04 22:25:21	Turquoise	unironically
2019-02-04 22:25:29	Turquoise	it's... organized ?

2019-02-04 22:27:06	@gwu	the germans, and internationals are forced to learn french

2019-02-04 22:28:17	Turquoise	so it's not as localised as some other languages
2019-02-04 22:28:31	OTheB	French is spoken in every continent, but Spanish is the most widely spoken.
2019-02-04 22:28:35	Turquoise	yes
2019-02-04 22:28:38	@gwu	AND AN EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT ISN'T THERE TO TEACH YOU LANGUAGES THE RIGHT WAY IN THE FIRST PLACE
2019-02-04 22:28:40	@gwu	FUCK
2019-02-04 22:28:41	OTheB	They're both not nice languages though
2019-02-04 22:28:56	Turquoise	if you can learn spanish you can learn french to be honest

2019-02-04 22:30:33	Turquoise	what is the best sounding language in your opinion
2019-02-04 22:30:41	Turquoise	i'd probably say italian
2019-02-04 22:30:50	OTheB	Some linguists *do* engineer languages
2019-02-04 22:30:57	OTheB	Called "conlanging"
2019-02-04 22:31:05	@gwu	to express more meaning and more information than currently possible with the least amount of effort

2019-02-04 22:33:40	Turquoise	apparently romanian is the closest you'll be able to find to latin

2019-02-04 22:34:06	OTheB	German and English are both very Germanic languages. Spanish is in the romantic family with French.

2019-02-04 22:34:12	Turquoise	yes
2019-02-04 22:34:12	@gwu	ithkuil has funny symbols owo
2019-02-04 22:34:18	Turquoise	spanish and french are quite similar
2019-02-04 22:34:19	OTheB	Learning English and German won't help much with Spanish
2019-02-04 22:34:22	Turquoise	i'd say like 80%
2019-02-04 22:34:58	Turquoise	the local languages and dialects in france are quite interesting
2019-02-04 22:35:09	Turquoise	like, occitan is clearly latin
2019-02-04 22:35:15	@gwu	ithkuil is already fucking with my head OTheB: thx
2019-02-04 22:35:17	Turquoise	but breton is a celtic language
2019-02-04 22:35:22	Turquoise	so it doesn't share shit with french
2019-02-04 22:35:50	OTheB	@grimm Just remember that if you put enough effort in to learn it to fluency then you get this fucking massive reward because you'd be the first human in the world to ever be fluent in it
2019-02-04 22:35:57	Turquoise	kek

2019-02-04 22:37:24	Turquoise	i knew people who were still fluent in breton
2019-02-04 22:37:30	Turquoise	and who knew people who didn't speak french at all
2019-02-04 22:37:34	OTheB	Some human brought up speaking Ithkuil natively that's able to think at full-speed Ithkuil speech could theoretically think at around 6 times the speed of a similarly competend English speaker
2019-02-04 22:37:40	Turquoise	so it died like, not even a century ago

2019-02-04 22:46:39	DewWisp	You said the French Ç is pronounced "ss", so does the German ß. Does the French Ç work like the German ß in that it denotes any previous vowels as long or diphthongs

2019-02-04 22:48:18	DewWisp	ß is pronounced "ss" (not "sz"). If ß follows a single vowel, that vowel becomes "long". If ß follows multiple vowels, it denotes them as a diphthong.
2019-02-04 22:48:24	OTheB	I'm really happy with how questions work in Akal. You just put the marker on what you're querying or sub in a question word and you suddenly have a question. Like "what's that?" would be "ide shede?" which is literally "that [unknown noun]?"
2019-02-04 22:48:34	@gwu	our (now actually french) french teacher tells us to abandon all hopes of finding perfect structure in french. if a rule is stated, don't ask for exeptions, they haven't been mentioned for your sake.

2019-02-05 00:44:27	davidv7	but im guessing it's something that triggers on exhaustion
2019-02-05 00:44:52	davidv7	what cardio does, is increase your capacity of doing stuff until you get exhausted/winded
2019-02-05 00:45:06	davidv7	what im certain you can do is yoga/stretching for a while
2019-02-05 00:45:29	davidv7	yoga is fun as fuck and can be actually impossible for us sedentary folk
2019-02-05 00:46:39	DewWisp	My asthma is triggered by any arobic exercise. I can sit-ups and pullups all day, but running will have me winded in less than 40 seconds

2019-02-05 04:13:48	Anna	@_diamondburned_ you were looking for a way to have a notification that updates right?
2019-02-05 04:13:48	Anna	I found this

2019-02-05 04:14:36	Anna	but i read like 5 lines and it  seems kinda cool
2019-02-05 04:14:38	_diamondburned_	This is doable without gdbus
2019-02-05 04:14:41	DewWisp	What would a mediocre 128gb external ssd run me?
2019-02-05 04:14:42	_diamondburned_	You could use dbus-send
2019-02-05 04:15:12	_diamondburned_	I've implemented notifications manually with dbus before in Go
2019-02-05 04:15:19	_diamondburned_	Should be the same for dbus-send
2019-02-05 04:15:26	DewWisp	Would it be better to put my new linux install on an external ssd or a 128gb usb3.0 flash drive?
2019-02-05 04:15:28	Anna	Ah, sorry
2019-02-05 04:15:35	_diamondburned_	Nah it's fine
2019-02-05 04:15:42	_diamondburned_	Put it in tools
2019-02-05 04:15:46	_diamondburned_	Might be useful for others
2019-02-05 04:15:59	_diamondburned_	@DewWisp what sounds better to yo
2019-02-05 04:16:00	_diamondburned_	you
2019-02-05 04:16:40	DewWisp	id say the usb, but what manufacturer should i buy from? sandisk? kingston? lexar?
2019-02-05 04:17:10	DewWisp	how can i minimize the risk of the flash drive corrupting like this one did
2019-02-05 04:17:20	lidl_papi	backup
2019-02-05 04:17:26	DewWisp	No like
2019-02-05 04:17:34	DewWisp	The flash drive is unusable

2019-02-05 04:18:42	DewWisp	again, what manufacturer?
2019-02-05 04:19:10	DewWisp	SanDisk, Kingston, Lexar? Someone else?
2019-02-05 04:20:24	_diamondburned_	Why the hell would you prefer a USB
2019-02-05 04:20:33	_diamondburned_	Which has 1/5th speed
2019-02-05 04:20:39	_diamondburned_	A worse chip
2019-02-05 04:20:50	_diamondburned_	And a less powerful controller
2019-02-05 04:20:55	DewWisp	I dont have the money for an ssd atm
2019-02-05 04:21:08	DewWisp	also ssd is less portable
2019-02-05 04:21:10	_diamondburned_	and what of the external ssd?
2019-02-05 04:21:22	_diamondburned_	Yes, but you don't need portability for a system installation
2019-02-05 04:21:57	DewWisp	The point of my linux flash drive is that i dont current own a desktop or laptop, the flash drive allows me to use linux wherever
2019-02-05 04:22:31	_diamondburned_	Specifically where?
2019-02-05 04:22:50	_diamondburned_	If you don't own any devices, you likely won't be able to use your drive either
2019-02-05 04:22:56	DewWisp	anywhere, at school, at home on the family pc, at my friends house
2019-02-05 04:23:02	_diamondburned_	Your school computer likely has BIOS locked
2019-02-05 04:23:07	DewWisp	Nope
2019-02-05 04:23:15	_diamondburned_	sure then
2019-02-05 04:23:18	DewWisp	I work for my schools IT department
2019-02-05 04:23:29	_diamondburned_	Sounds like an answer
2019-02-05 04:23:41	_diamondburned_	Not sure why you would ask questions when you already have your answer
2019-02-05 04:23:52	_diamondburned_	Great way to waste others' time

2019-02-05 10:33:28	jb	feminism is much more open to interpretation, because of just how old the movement is and how broad the concept of egalitarianism can be when your parameters are solely based on gender
2019-02-05 10:33:37	@gwu	xent: time yourself on how much of the go standard library you can understand.
2019-02-05 10:33:48	jb	feminazism is pretty straightforward political circlejerking and autistic activism

2019-02-05 10:36:03	jb	I mean, yeah

2019-02-05 10:39:12	jb	fact of the matter is that we don't need to be overly acceptive in order to be tolerant

2019-02-05 10:40:19	@gwu	maybe it's easy for me to say since i'm half german and half philipino, and generally disconnected with both cultures, really. but i still think the divide culture brings is far worse than the strength in identity it gives those that can identify with it.
2019-02-05 10:40:25	Renzix	As long as 1 person exists who is racist people need education
2019-02-05 10:40:50	Renzix	Its a double edged sword and if not weilded properly can be even worse

2019-02-05 10:41:19	@gwu	why?
2019-02-05 10:41:22	@gwu	because of language
2019-02-05 10:41:46	jb	want it or not, if something works, there is no need to fix it. that's common sense. it's not correct, but it's intuitive enough so that your singleton, common Joe abides to it without thinking twice
2019-02-05 10:41:58	@gwu	the fuckers from the middle-east are taking up gyms, and raping women on concerts in germany

2019-02-05 10:42:09	@gwu	religion
2019-02-05 10:42:11	jb	so traditions help in this kind of regard, *when* they are actually not prejudice

2019-02-05 10:49:20	Renzix	this has nothing to do with islam
2019-02-05 10:49:27	@gwu	that's why i don't believe in that shit either
2019-02-05 10:49:30	Renzix	this is middle easterners
2019-02-05 10:49:49	@gwu	Karl Marx: "Religion is opium for the masses"
2019-02-05 10:50:12	jb	"And Marxism is opium for the intellectuals"
2019-02-05 10:50:26	@gwu	that doesn't null the things marx said.
2019-02-05 10:50:27	Renzix	"Long live the plebians"

2019-02-05 10:51:09	HeeBoo	religion are just scapegoat
2019-02-05 10:51:19	jb	no duh
2019-02-05 10:51:47	jb	it's canonically how religions  and cults sprung up: as an excuse to answer shit we can't or don't want to know or talk about
2019-02-05 10:51:57	jb	EDIT: it's canonically how religions and cults sprung up: as an excuse to answer shit we can't or don't want to know or talk about
2019-02-05 10:53:17	HeeBoo	that's not my point, just religion's habit are now in entire relation with money
2019-02-05 10:53:54	jb	oh
2019-02-05 10:54:01	@gwu	we can explain most things now... though no life after death is a bit difficult to take in for people that believed in it so desperately
2019-02-05 10:54:01	jb	I guess
2019-02-05 10:54:29	@gwu	oh yeah, i liked sin-tax

2019-02-05 10:54:56	Renzix	i cant see
2019-02-05 10:55:00	jb	don't you say
2019-02-05 10:55:01	jb	lol
2019-02-05 10:55:02	Renzix	its all black
2019-02-05 10:55:09	@gwu	oh nice
2019-02-05 10:55:11	jb	braille characters
2019-02-05 10:55:12	yemou	moved it to #devnull

2019-02-05 10:55:14	jb	maybe that's why
2019-02-05 10:55:22	Renzix	Anyway there is plenty of stuff science still cant explain
2019-02-05 10:55:33	Renzix	that it fundementally will never be able to explain
2019-02-05 10:55:39	yemou	like why my pee pee grew into my body
2019-02-05 10:55:50	@gwu	renzix, yeah but all the simple stuff which religion tries to, is explained
2019-02-05 10:55:52	jb	P vs NP btw
2019-02-05 10:56:00	jb	uh, no dude
2019-02-05 10:56:09	jb	religion, by definition, deals with the supernatural
2019-02-05 10:56:12	jb	the unknown etc.
2019-02-05 10:56:15	@gwu	yeah
2019-02-05 10:56:17	@gwu	that too
2019-02-05 10:56:25	Renzix	Explain the begging of the universe
2019-02-05 10:56:35	Renzix	how can there be something from nothing
2019-02-05 10:56:53	@gwu	i can't.
2019-02-05 10:56:54	jb	the universe dillatation theory already does that
2019-02-05 10:56:55	jb	kek
2019-02-05 10:57:21	@gwu	though how does hawking radiation work?
2019-02-05 10:57:39	jb	*yeah...* that is way more complicated
2019-02-05 10:57:42	@gwu	it's those little particles that just start existing every now and again
2019-02-05 10:57:42	Renzix	then how

2019-02-05 10:58:26	@gwu	if they can't (one particle is pulled into the black hole)
2019-02-05 10:58:29	jb	existance is not an object to be acted upon, hence it can't "exist"
2019-02-05 10:58:51	@gwu	the other flies away as part of the general hawking radiation of a black hole
2019-02-05 10:58:59	@gwu	that's really oversimplified, yeah
2019-02-05 10:59:09	@gwu	but it gets the point across, i think
2019-02-05 10:59:17	jb	but like, it's not complicated to explain how it happens
2019-02-05 10:59:21	jb	it's way more harder to explain why
2019-02-05 10:59:32	@gwu	dont't try
2019-02-05 11:00:09	jb	I don't need to. my bf does that shit for me in random conversations
2019-02-05 11:00:36	Renzix	But matter needs to exist for dilation no?
2019-02-05 11:01:55	jb	yeah, and it can "start" existing through condensed particles, overexposed to extreme heat for a long time
2019-02-05 11:02:08	jb	but, long, as in, hundreds of billions of years
2019-02-05 11:02:12	Renzix	Where do particles come from tho
2019-02-05 11:02:27	Renzix	they just existed?
2019-02-05 11:02:35	jb	the theory of hawking radiation explains a way they can just "appear"
2019-02-05 11:02:42	jb	and it doesn't even require time
2019-02-05 11:02:46	xent	this is probably a dumb question but why is "vim" not working in bash
2019-02-05 11:02:48	jb	(or space, by proxy)
2019-02-05 11:02:50	xent	the command
2019-02-05 11:02:51	jb	it just happens
2019-02-05 11:03:18	jb	@xent does it print anything when you invoke it?
2019-02-05 11:03:35	xent	not a valid command
2019-02-05 11:04:00	jb	did you change your PATH variable at any point?
2019-02-05 11:04:21	jb	otherwise, if vim is in it (which is probably is), then it should've worked
2019-02-05 11:04:43	xent	ok
2019-02-05 11:04:46	xent	i dunno
2019-02-05 11:04:47	jb	either that or vim is loading bad config files
2019-02-05 11:05:01	xent	i'll check tmrw i have to get off pc

2019-02-05 12:23:59	jb	there are barely any "Linux reviewing" channels afaik

2019-02-05 12:48:14	@gwu	or are you forced?
2019-02-05 12:51:23	jb	@Clay can't you just get the platform with `platform.system()`, `sys.platform` etc. and run the batch script?

2019-02-05 17:49:38	Turquoise	getting your own kernel config to work just right requires a bit of trial and error + a lot of googling around but it's not that bad
2019-02-05 17:49:46	Turquoise	otherwise gentoo seems quite straightforward

2019-02-05 19:42:52	Turquoise	[19:22:10] so (()) is the workaround
2019-02-05 19:42:52	Turquoise	[19:22:13] both are good
2019-02-05 19:42:52	Turquoise	[19:22:16] depending on the context
2019-02-05 19:42:52	viz	[19:22:16] Oh. I didn't know that
2019-02-05 19:42:52	Turquoise	[19:22:21] there is no reason to use seq
2019-02-05 19:42:52	Turquoise	[19:22:26] except in posix sh
2019-02-05 19:42:52	viz	[19:22:46] Id rather use a while loop tbh
2019-02-05 19:42:52	Turquoise	[19:22:47] and even then i'd rather write a seq function i think
2019-02-05 19:42:52	^_^	[19:23:04] I hate while loops since you have to use `do done`
2019-02-05 19:42:52	^_^	[19:23:13] i like my `{ }`
2019-02-05 19:42:52	^_^	[19:23:34] `for (()); { :;}`

2019-02-05 21:02:07	_diamondburned_	gotta check if they put anime, art or nohting tho
2019-02-05 21:02:37	ym555	maybe make the input format this?
2019-02-05 21:02:45	ym555	`section one, section two`

2019-02-06 02:25:23	_diamondburned_	If you have to resort to using JS to style
2019-02-06 02:25:29	_diamondburned_	You might as well go jump down a pit and die

2019-02-06 02:28:43	Anna	when the 2nd object with an arrow is hovered, it does display none on the object in the first arrow
2019-02-06 02:28:58	_diamondburned_	So use ~
2019-02-06 02:29:06	Anna	if i wanted to do it the other way, i'd do
2019-02-06 02:29:06	Anna	```css
2019-02-06 02:29:06	Anna	.tab-icon-image:hover ~ .tab-close-button {

2019-02-06 02:29:12	Anna	that doest work that way i thought
2019-02-06 02:29:18	_diamondburned_	Wdym
2019-02-06 02:29:20	stairmast0r	what's a good WM that is not i3-gaps

2019-02-06 02:29:50	stairmast0r	i tried bspwm before and enjoyed it as far as configuration/etc goes, but i think i don't know how to work with it properly
2019-02-06 02:30:00	lidl_papi	ok not dwm then
2019-02-06 02:30:05	davidv7	hlwm

2019-02-06 02:30:07	stairmast0r	like i was trying to use it as i3 when it wasn't

2019-02-06 05:25:33	Vesim	so the configuration of the screen is kinda controlled by the intel gpu

2019-02-06 05:35:34	Renzix	and under X server Display Configurations

2019-02-06 05:37:26	Renzix	idk why
2019-02-06 05:37:31	Renzix	you need to use xrandr
2019-02-06 05:37:44	davidv7	i'll re-use the script that worked fine on arch

2019-02-06 05:40:44	Renzix	wat
2019-02-06 05:41:03	davidv7	too long of an output
2019-02-06 05:41:08	davidv7	and i can't really be jumping around much
2019-02-06 05:41:10	davidv7	since it's fucked
2019-02-06 05:41:33	davidv7	but it finds eDP-1-1, VGA-1-1, and HDMI-1-1 as it should
2019-02-06 05:41:39	davidv7	again, the problem isnt being found
2019-02-06 05:41:45	Renzix	which one is on the left?
2019-02-06 05:41:45	davidv7	the problem is that they're overlayed somehow
2019-02-06 05:41:58	Renzix	yea you need to tell xrandr which one is left/right
2019-02-06 05:42:06	davidv7	i told it VGA-1-1 top
2019-02-06 05:42:06	Renzix	and it will do it for you
2019-02-06 05:42:09	davidv7	no it wont
2019-02-06 05:42:18	davidv7	its still 1 big monitor
2019-02-06 05:42:23	davidv7	except now half of it is on top of it
2019-02-06 05:42:25	davidv7	instead of to the right
2019-02-06 05:42:30	davidv7	since the resolutions arent the same
2019-02-06 05:42:46	davidv7	there's literally a 1600x900 display INSIDE this https://0x0.st/zsyQ.png
2019-02-06 05:43:14	davidv7	https://0x0.st/zsy1.png

2019-02-06 05:55:49	Renzix	EDIT: `feh` `nitrogen` `xsetroot` or `hsetroot` are best background setters
2019-02-06 05:56:01	lidl_papi	it's in aur `aur/bgs-git`
2019-02-06 05:56:16	Renzix	all of those are in offical repos uwu
2019-02-06 05:56:36	lidl_papi	why are they the best?
2019-02-06 05:56:41	lidl_papi	people are just used to what's popular
2019-02-06 05:56:57	xent	i might use xsetroot for solid color
2019-02-06 05:57:13	Renzix	x/hsetroot are built by the makers of Xorg
2019-02-06 05:57:24	lidl_papi	and X is bloated
2019-02-06 05:57:24	Renzix	feh is also a image viewer which is really nice
2019-02-06 05:57:31	Renzix	Then don't use it

2019-02-06 06:10:30	davidv7	why would i virtualize that, i'd run out of ram instantly
2019-02-06 06:10:38	davidv7	it's really tight as it is

2019-02-06 06:11:52	davidv7	just without the exams
2019-02-06 06:11:55	davidv7	part of the curriculum
2019-02-06 06:12:23	davidv7	setting up hardware is a big pain in the ass if you gotta do it weekly, which is why we virtualize it for those type of stuff
2019-02-06 06:12:30	davidv7	easier to grade, easier to troubleshoot etc.
2019-02-06 06:13:03	davidv7	you are running a legit cisco IOS image too, can change up a bunch of stuff like RAM, room temperature and shit
2019-02-06 06:13:55	_diamondburned_	are you virtualizing just network setups and stuff?
2019-02-06 06:14:01	_diamondburned_	do you simulate attacks or sth

2019-02-06 06:18:21	davidv7	and yeah u can simulate attacks just like you would with a real computer
2019-02-06 06:18:27	davidv7	you can enter command lines for each node

2019-02-06 07:44:59	_diamondburned_	[07:22:57] less chars != clarity
2019-02-06 07:44:59	ym555	[07:23:25] yes, but removing useless chars gives clarity
2019-02-06 07:44:59	Bulk_Dogan	[07:23:27] I forgot to change my bottom bar to have the same wood texture. Fixed.
2019-02-06 07:44:59	ym555	[07:23:34] you just get to the point
2019-02-06 07:44:59	Bandit	[07:23:48] Just imagine this conversation in real life. Like if this was a work meeting, and two coworkers were in a heated stylistic debate, and then some dude dressed up like a wrestler is just trying to show the both of them his windowmaker setup.
2019-02-06 07:44:59	Bulk_Dogan	[07:24:05] We can all take a chill pill and install Windowmaker.
2019-02-06 07:44:59	Bulk_Dogan	[07:24:13] Go to the light
2019-02-06 07:44:59	Bandit	[07:24:25] i'm already windowmaker
2019-02-06 07:44:59	Bulk_Dogan	[07:24:30] The desktop where Stevejobs and RMS had a baby
2019-02-06 07:44:59	lidl_papi	[07:25:05] i like implicit returns in elixir and rust
2019-02-06 07:44:59	DewWisp	[07:25:07] apache has the ultra super mega gay
2019-02-06 07:44:59	Bulk_Dogan	[07:25:28] What is wrong with apache?

2019-02-06 07:44:59	tdeo	[07:29:04] what
2019-02-06 07:44:59	_diamondburned_	[07:29:05] also code is hacky as hell tbh

2019-02-06 07:44:59	tdeo	[07:29:07] why
2019-02-06 07:44:59	_diamondburned_	[07:29:12] 🤷
2019-02-06 07:44:59	ym555	[07:29:22] big brain devs
2019-02-06 07:44:59	_diamondburned_	[07:29:24] was talking to some guy while looking at PRs
2019-02-06 07:44:59	_diamondburned_	[07:29:30] saw this huge PR https://github.com/andersfylling/disgord/pull/110/files
2019-02-06 07:44:59	Bandit	[07:29:51] @Bulk_Dogan what's your screen res?
2019-02-06 07:44:59	Bulk_Dogan	[07:30:01] 1920x1080
2019-02-06 07:44:59	tdeo	[07:30:05] commented out code in the first patch chunk lmao
2019-02-06 07:44:59	Bulk_Dogan	[07:30:10] 1MS response time
2019-02-06 07:44:59	Bandit	[07:30:39] I'm on a 768p thinkpad, which makes ricing slightly more challenging. I'm using Gnome, but I almost never have a window not maximized.
2019-02-06 07:44:59	ym555	[07:30:42] @lidl_papi implicit returns are a side effect of those languages being "expression-based", every block returns *something*
2019-02-06 07:44:59	Bandit	[07:31:08] 12" 1366x768, I don't feel like I can have windows take up only a part of the screen and still be useful
2019-02-06 07:44:59	_diamondburned_	[07:32:34] I have a 19" 900p screen
2019-02-06 07:44:59	_diamondburned_	[07:32:41] and a 10.1" 768p screen
2019-02-06 07:44:59	_diamondburned_	[07:32:41] kek
2019-02-06 07:44:59	_diamondburned_	[07:33:00] Small one is barless

2019-02-06 07:44:59	Superuser_	[07:33:18] A fucking hp monitor
2019-02-06 07:44:59	_diamondburned_	[07:33:25] Windows not taking the entire screen is never useful tbh
2019-02-06 07:44:59	_diamondburned_	[07:33:39] It's purely aesthetics
2019-02-06 07:44:59	IgnisCyan	[07:34:00] hey diamond
2019-02-06 07:44:59	IgnisCyan	[07:34:12] Do you have experience with LDM?

2019-02-06 07:44:59	Jake_Moon	[07:40:47] 768p is very common on laptops
2019-02-06 07:44:59	Jake_Moon	[07:41:01] Well, unless you fork into 600+
2019-02-06 07:44:59	_diamondburned_	[07:41:08] oo

2019-02-06 07:50:15	_diamondburned_	kek
2019-02-06 07:50:22	_diamondburned_	prob because it thinks its a pdf or sth
2019-02-06 07:50:22	natemonster321	instead of bookworm's approach
2019-02-06 07:50:22	_diamondburned_	idk
2019-02-06 07:50:34	natemonster321	apparently dev wants to implement pagination into bookworm tho
2019-02-06 07:50:38	natemonster321	so i guess that's alright
2019-02-06 07:50:42	natemonster321	i'll just wait until that happens
2019-02-06 07:50:59	natemonster321	because otherwise, bookworm renders properly
2019-02-06 07:51:00	_diamondburned_	wait
2019-02-06 07:51:03	_diamondburned_	bookworm doesn't have it?

2019-02-06 07:51:09	natemonster321	epubs are by chapter
2019-02-06 07:51:13	natemonster321	it's only epubs that don't paginate tho
2019-02-06 07:51:24	_diamondburned_	yeah because the other shit has its own pagination rules
2019-02-06 07:51:27	natemonster321	yeah
2019-02-06 07:51:28	_diamondburned_	tbh not paginating is homosexual

2019-02-06 08:23:03	Superuser_	its easier but a dumb idea
2019-02-06 08:23:04	Bear	Not easy when you consider all the stupid shit.
2019-02-06 08:23:07	Bear	Just install Arch.
2019-02-06 08:23:07	qutebrowser_	So anything with an installer should be fine

2019-02-06 08:23:36	Bulk_Dogan	Wait, why?
2019-02-06 08:23:39	qutebrowser_	Its still Gentoo based no? Even tho it uses apt
2019-02-06 08:23:42	Bear	Antergos isn't bad.
2019-02-06 08:23:44	Brian_Quinn	I thought Chrome OS was based on Gentoo?

2019-02-06 17:21:43	jeevanet	Can anyone recommend a good linux backup program? Something that administrators can manage through a web interface as well ? - I've tested a bunch of these free versions on my LAB but they all seem to struggle when you want to backup 0.5-2 PB of data.

2019-02-06 17:22:12	OTheB	uuuhhh. What's wrong with rsync?

2019-02-06 17:22:24	OTheB	Can just make a big button that backs everything up
2019-02-06 17:22:42	OTheB	Works over ssh too
2019-02-06 17:22:59	jeevanet	then you will have to provide them with ssh access ...
2019-02-06 17:23:23	OTheB	Better than web access
2019-02-06 17:23:27	OTheB	Much less overhead
2019-02-06 17:24:06	OTheB	The SSH just needs to be for an unpriviledged user with no login shell because it's not needed. rsync then just does the full backup to the backup location
2019-02-06 17:24:25	OTheB	Depends if your backups are mounted locally or are being done over network
2019-02-06 17:24:41	jeevanet	cephfs
2019-02-06 17:24:48	OTheB	If they're mounted locally then all SSH is needed for is running the one rsync command
2019-02-06 17:25:10	jeevanet	EDIT: cephfs + openstack
2019-02-06 17:25:13	OTheB	You could create a special backup user which only has permissing to run the rsync command and rw to *just* the right directories.
2019-02-06 17:25:25	OTheB	EDIT: You could create a special backup user which only has permission to run the rsync command and rw to *just* the right directories.
2019-02-06 17:25:37	jeevanet	yeah but that doesn't meet my requirements
2019-02-06 17:26:07	OTheB	Press button > backup happens
2019-02-06 17:26:13	OTheB	EDIT: Press button -> backup happens

2019-02-06 17:29:34	@gwu	i don't get why people use cron...
2019-02-06 17:29:46	OTheB	@jeeva.net you're describing two different tools. rsync does backups *really well*. You're asking for a WUI (already a mistake) for looking at information about backups and triggering them. These would be two completely distinct tools.
2019-02-06 17:30:09	@gwu	oh and: opendns vs 1111 vs google vs quad9?
2019-02-06 17:30:25	OTheB	One tool does backup, the other serves a WUI that reads and displays logs and gives you a button to manually start a backup.
2019-02-06 17:30:53	OTheB	@grimm Not Google, don't know what the others are.
2019-02-06 17:31:04	@gwu	cloudflare's 1111
2019-02-06 17:31:08	OTheB	Oh no wait I've seen OpenDNS before
2019-02-06 17:31:20	@gwu	open and quad9 i haven't heard of either
2019-02-06 17:31:24	OTheB	My parents used it to censor the shit out of our internet ages ago
2019-02-06 17:31:34	@gwu	but they seem to get rid of my isp's pornhub block, so i'm fine
2019-02-06 17:31:36	OTheB	Before they knew what VPNs and Tor were lmao
2019-02-06 17:31:39	jeevanet	rsync just feels so slow
2019-02-06 17:31:47	jeevanet	only do about 600GB in 24 hours
2019-02-06 17:31:53	@gwu	rsync is great
2019-02-06 17:31:58	@gwu	if you know how to use it
2019-02-06 17:32:02	OTheB	Compress your files first
2019-02-06 17:32:06	jeevanet	and we have full 100Gbe network
2019-02-06 17:32:13	jeevanet	and hosts
2019-02-06 17:32:19	@gwu	jeevanet: use lrzip for big files
2019-02-06 17:32:23	OTheB	If these are big files then you could tar -> lrzip -> rsync
2019-02-06 17:32:34	OTheB	Could dramatically drop the size
