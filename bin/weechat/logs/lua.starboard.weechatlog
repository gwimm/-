2019-01-23 21:37:52	<~OTheB>	Matrix in general seems iffy with them
2019-01-23 21:38:28	<~OTheB>	Like you can set it once and it won't show it changed, but if you come back the next day it has
2019-01-23 21:38:52	< diamondburned>	well crap because ive set like 12  times each with a different pic

2019-01-30 21:00:33	< gwu>	yeah it does, didn't expect it to
2019-01-30 13:00:58	<~OTheB>	Because you're used to Discord which just fucking dies every other day
2019-01-30 21:03:45	< gwu>	how have you been using discord?
2019-01-30 13:04:37	<~OTheB>	At first with the Electron thing, but more recently I've relegated it to Firefox
2019-01-30 13:05:01	<~OTheB>	Interestingly, Discord is fine in Firefox on Linux but looks fucking terrible on Firefox on Windows
2019-01-30 21:27:00	< gwu>	oh yeah it does look horrible on windows
2019-01-30 21:27:05	< gwu>	the scrollbars xD
2019-01-30 13:27:18	<~OTheB>	And the white bars
2019-01-30 13:27:47	<~OTheB>	https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/v1/download/matrix.org/bLlzpnqpGVNQZRJOMcmFJnGg/fractal-pasted-image
2019-01-30 21:28:05	< gwu>	oh lord...
2019-01-30 13:28:10	<~OTheB>	Down the right of the channel list and user list
2019-01-30 21:28:13	< gwu>	https://github.com/khyperia/weechat-discord
2019-01-30 21:28:19	< gwu>	you think this still works?
2019-01-30 13:28:24	<~OTheB>	And they get huge if you change the zoom off 100%
2019-01-30 13:28:28	<~OTheB>	Try it?
2019-01-30 21:28:39	< gwu>	it says: `Deadness indicator: 100%`
2019-01-30 13:28:50	<~OTheB>	lmao
2019-01-30 21:28:57	< gwu>	```
2019-01-30 21:28:59	< gwu>	I'm done. I'm 900% done. Someone can feel free to fork this jar of horrors, but I'm done dealing with the nightmare of the Discord protocol.
2019-01-30 13:29:16	<~OTheB>	Fair enough
2019-01-30 21:29:34	< gwu>	there's an active fork...
2019-01-30 21:29:54	< gwu>	oof...
2019-01-30 21:29:56	< gwu>	This program is very likely against TOS, but there is no (?) colloquial evidence of Discord banning users for using custom clients and not spamming
2019-01-30 22:08:59	< gwu>	this works really well...
2019-01-30 22:09:16	< gwu>	though the discord plugin could be faster, at least on the client side
2019-01-31 01:54:37	< gwu>	oh yeah i am OTheB
2019-01-31 01:54:40	< gwu>	yeet
2019-01-31 02:33:10	< gwu>	but now i'm using bitlbee for discord
2019-01-31 02:33:23	< gwu>	bitlbee is actually really cool
2019-01-31 03:02:32	< diamondburned>	lmao gwimm is here
2019-01-31 03:02:48	< diamondburned>	>This program is very likely against TOS, but there is no (?) colloquial evidence of Discord banning users for using custom clients and not spamming
