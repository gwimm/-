2019-01-30 06:46:00	IndigoLaser	@diamondburned#4507 Lol I just downloaded another torrent and it didn't need any installing/configuring and run completely fine with wine.

2019-01-30 09:50:36	IndigoLaser	Why is it that if I run wine PvZ.exe in the folder PvZ.exe is in, it works, but if I do wine ~/Downloads/PvZ/PvZ.exe it doesn't work?
2019-01-30 09:51:17	IndigoLaser	Do I have to specify some arguments to wine to make it work?
2019-01-30 10:32:37	Dafman	I've tried out Latte Dock on KDE but decided I didn't like it. Now I can't seem to get rid of it whatsoever. I tried uninstalling through terminal and through octopi but the dock just stays there andit just removes the settings when I uninstall. Is there any way to remove it permanently?

2019-01-31 01:27:18	natemonster321	@IndigoLaser#1436 i think the issue is that some windows binaries just expect to be run from the directory they're in, and when they aren't (which is kind of hard to do in windows since in file explorer you have to navigate to the file anyway, and it by default is set to start in its own directory), they just break
