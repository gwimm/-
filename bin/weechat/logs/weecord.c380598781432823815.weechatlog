2019-01-31 00:38:09		Where are you opening the powershell window? It must be used in the ~\PerformanceCalculator\bin\Debug\netcoreapp2.0 folder. In any case, make sure you follow VINXIS' video step by step if you're new to this (which we might want to add to the README for newbies).

2019-01-31 00:47:20		The readme instructions are misleading currently.
