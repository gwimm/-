2019-01-24 18:39:43	gwosix	g'day
2019-01-24 18:39:47	vdamewood	yuung_: After you have authorized_keys set up, ssh back into the debian box, then run "ssh <mac user>@<mac internal ip address> say It worked.
2019-01-24 18:40:04	vdamewood	s/run "/run: /
2019-01-24 18:40:05	gwosix	you guys doing ssh?
2019-01-24 18:40:06	yuung_	vdamewood, okay, did that.  so i'm guessing this step....created a public ssh key on my vm, then copied to an "allowed users to ssh into" file on my local machine? vdamewood
2019-01-24 18:40:17	vdamewood	yuung_: Exactly.

2019-01-24 18:40:57	yuung_	omg awesome!
2019-01-24 18:41:00	yuung_	vdamewood thank youuu
2019-01-24 18:41:16	yuung_	y to circumvent this?
2019-01-24 18:41:34	yuung_	sigh.  let me retype:  the ssh command asked for a password. is there a way to circumvent this?
2019-01-24 18:41:49	vdamewood	yuung_: If you want to do this again in the future, and you already have an authorized keys file. Do this to ADD the key: cat foo.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
2019-01-24 18:41:57	yuung_	i got a new laptop and am still getting used to the keys (yes this is the lamest excuse ever)
2019-01-24 18:41:57	vdamewood	yuung_: this exchanging of keys was supposed to do that.
2019-01-24 18:42:31	yuung_	vdamewood, i see i see.  awesome :D
2019-01-24 18:43:24	vdamewood	yuung_: So, if it doesn't work, then your mac's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys doesn't have your debian system's ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub in it.
2019-01-24 18:43:48	yuung_	vdamewood, it did work - sorry that wasn't clear
2019-01-24 18:43:58	vdamewood	Without a password?
2019-01-24 18:44:12	yuung_	ah, yeah it still asked for a password
2019-01-24 18:44:26	yuung_	but, i managed to connect to the mac and run `say`.  let me check my ssh keys again
2019-01-24 18:44:56	vdamewood	It shouldn't ask for a password when you ssh from debian to mac.
2019-01-24 18:45:02	yuung_	OH
2019-01-24 18:45:05	vdamewood	This won't, however, solve the process of sshing from mac to debian.

2019-01-24 18:47:05	yuung_	okay, so i had accidentally copied the private key in the original step, not the public key (classic ssh noob mistake right)
2019-01-24 18:47:25	yuung_	but, now i have the id_rsa.pub file, but it asks me for its passphrase when i run the ssh command
2019-01-24 18:47:44	vdamewood	yuung_: Make a new public key without passphrase.
2019-01-24 18:48:11	vdamewood	(just hit enter when prompted to enter the passphrase)
2019-01-24 18:48:12	yuung_	okay!

2019-01-24 19:20:52	velco	OtakuSenpai, instead of executing a call instruction, pop the stack and do a jump

Random memory access patterns and constant cache misses. In an attempt to improve performance, you try to parallelize parts of the code, but it takes heroic efforts, and, in the end, you barely get much of a speed-up due to all the synchronization you had to add. To top it off

2019-01-24 22:50:36	mrig	just treat errors as -h
2019-01-24 22:51:06	msiism	mrig: i'd generally abstain from printing out help contents if they are not requested explicitly. i use $help_info for that, which just says "Run '$cmd -h' for help."
2019-01-24 22:51:36	msiism	because if you treat erros as -h, -h would have to go to stderr in one case and to stdout in another (when explicitly requested)

There's no actual versioning, you're running out of a fixed directory location.

2019-01-25 04:44:31	jonwoodlief	So your insurance price propogates from three sources. A) if bike thefts * $1 is higher than prev_month, than that's your bike insurance. B) bike thefts are lower than previous months' price but higher than half of previous months, so previous months propogates. And C) current bike thefts are less than 50% of previous months prices- so your new price is previous months minus $1

2019-01-25 07:09:35	avemi	what two hashing functions can I use for double hashing to resolve hash table collisions when size of the table is a power of two? CRLS shows ones that are suitable for the case when the size of the hash table is an odd number, but since the table needs to grow, having an odd number requires it to be known beforehand or computed from sieve, which brings additional complexity

2019-01-25 10:31:50	immibis	the agile approach sounds like it would work well in theory: more or less, have a list of things you want to happen, in priority order, and the devs do them in order, and they are done when they are done, and if not enough things are done by the deadline then your deadline was bad
2019-01-25 10:31:55	Tazmain	open plan offices actually negatively impact devs

2019-01-25 11:50:54	Tazmain	merijn, well it would be C++/C , I don't see any other language for that, certainly not python or Kotlin. And I don't know rust well enough
2019-01-25 11:50:55	Zelink	merijn: That means I have to find a company that sells VPSes without photo id (impossible today), takes Bitcon (even less chance) and then I have to set it up and eternally babysit it (security maintenance)... so it's not a solution.

2019-01-25 11:51:59	mrig	That said I don't want to get closed down by the server for making to many requests, better do so diligently.

2019-01-25 11:52:50	beaky	yes aws at least doesnt require a photo id last time i used it (just payment details)
2019-01-25 11:52:58	merijn	Tazmain: I did some raw audio manipulation at one point for a course, but that was just messing around with a raw wave file and outputting it. I don't think an audio codec is *inherently* hard, but writing a good one is tricky and realtime is hard

2019-01-25 12:43:16	manuel___	it's easy to spend days hacking on something that is actually detrimental to the product
2019-01-25 12:43:31	beaky	indeed. the "work smarter, not harder nor faster" factor at work
2019-01-25 12:43:44	mrig	cybex_ welcome to the club :)
2019-01-25 12:43:47	cybex_	manual___: I can tell you I had no problem with that. Where the bulk of my time goes is debugging.
2019-01-25 12:43:54	manuel___	doesn't mean you shouldn't be fast on tasks that you can be fast on
2019-01-25 12:44:05	manuel___	so why do you need debugging in the first place?
2019-01-25 12:44:33	manuel___	i usually use debugging only when i want to understand an unfamiliar codebase, or in python when i don't understand what the datatypes are
2019-01-25 12:45:08	manuel___	if i know my code has a bug, i will write a test so that i don't have to spend time debugging, or add tons of printfs that i can analyze with a script later on
2019-01-25 12:45:12	cybex_	I have been doing freelance work for a client, he is very happy with my work, and quite understanding too. However, I see that many times I would check if something works, then later something pops up agian that I missed. So many small things I would miss, and cause me grieff (nevermind anyone else who doesn't understand these oissues)
2019-01-25 12:45:22	mrig	just pondering stopping this question, or, going all out on it (I still want to go further on a previous question, but stopped figuring it best to do so when better versed)
2019-01-25 12:45:23	manuel___	becaue debugging is indeed the slowest and most easily misguiding task
2019-01-25 12:45:26	cybex_	I think that may give a better perspective of my meaning
2019-01-25 12:45:48	manuel___	so this seems like you don't have your problem specced out correctly, when you say "something I have missed"
2019-01-25 12:45:52	manuel___	do you have a concrete example?

One of the clients mentioned that the form components were overlapping on his 480p device. I created a 480p device (at that time HDPI scaling).

2019-01-25 18:12:54	jcotton	Zelink: azw3 is one of the native Kindle formats
2019-01-25 18:12:59	manuel_	aws services
2019-01-25 18:13:00	jcotton	ePub is a (mostly) universal format

2019-01-25 18:13:43	Zelink	I've long wanted to get into making magazines and stuff like that, but Adobe's PageMaker or whatever costs a fortune, and Scribus (the open source version) sucks.
2019-01-25 18:14:03	jcotton	Zelink: for a fixed layout thing like a magazine you'd use PDF

2019-01-30 10:57:36	standardname	a org is an organization
2019-01-30 10:57:40	standardname	a feature flag is a feature flag lol
2019-01-30 10:57:48	mahaxamo	a physical flag
2019-01-30 10:57:52	mahaxamo	like ships use for signalling?
2019-01-30 10:57:53	standardname	It's a flag for "unveiling" features
2019-01-30 10:57:55	standardname	no

2019-01-30 10:59:01	standardname	so internal users can view and test how it interacts with the system as a whole
2019-01-30 10:59:05	standardname	but it is obfuscated from everyone else

2019-02-02 09:59:09	jaarod	I'm not familiar with C#. in languages like ml, or haskell (I think F# as well), there's no concept of null reference. so if you want null-equivalent, you have to wrap your type in a Maybe/Option type, that provides that functionality
2019-02-02 10:00:05	wedr_	In C#, there is a .? operator, where the variable is allowed to be Null, or Non-Null data.
2019-02-02 10:00:49	wedr_	I think this Microsoft article explains it better than me. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/nullable-types/
2019-02-02 10:01:10	wedr_	But yeah. Just wondering if C++ has that sort of concept. But apparently, the answer is, "It doesn't".

2019-02-02 11:12:41	Quietwalker	I had an idea for a game once.   90% of the game is cyberspace like, but each company is a dungeon.  You go on quests, etc.  The twist is that your party members are  constructs you don't control directly, but set up with programming.  Like "health below 30, run heal.exe" or whatever.

2019-02-02 11:13:20	Quietwalker	and once you launch an assault on a site, it's realtimeish.  You can still issue updated commands or change profiles or (slowly) provide manual commands
2019-02-02 11:13:47	Quietwalker	but mostly you make sure you got the set you're running has the programming to do what you need it to do.
2019-02-02 11:14:07	vendu	Quietwalker, that's a good idea :)
2019-02-02 11:14:11	vendu	Quietwalker, programming games are
2019-02-02 11:14:26	vendu	Quietwalker, how about an MMORPG with partially human-lead gaming?
2019-02-02 11:14:37	wedr_	TIL if you have a MSDN subscription, you can install Visual Studio 1.0 (that's right, one-point-zero) onto Windows 10, and it would run and compile your old C89 code.
2019-02-02 11:14:47	vendu	so you'd have parts of the story written by the machine but humans to add depth and unpredictability to the experience :)
2019-02-02 11:14:57	vendu	this could be THE thing in gaming if done nicely :)
2019-02-02 11:15:18	vendu	Quietwalker, look at big gamehouses
2019-02-02 11:15:21	Quietwalker	vendu: yeah, my idea was to seed several 'main' story plots, and then have the rest be procedurally generated. So you could go off the reservation.
2019-02-02 11:15:23	vendu	that's where the big money is in software
2019-02-02 11:15:34	vendu	games would also be pretty much the damned best thing to program :)

2019-02-02 11:15:50	Quietwalker	as someone who did game programming early in his career, it is not that swell.

2019-02-02 11:15:57	Quietwalker	I guess if you do it for a hobby it can be fun

2019-02-02 13:31:02	_W_	daurnimator: well consider that practically all the elements of a hashing function already tries to mix and mangle bits in such a way that such information is _lost_ it becomes clear that any step that tilts things in favour of 0's would have to be towards the end of the sequence of operations - and thus, why not just add in zeroes at the end, position permutated based on some intermediary hash
