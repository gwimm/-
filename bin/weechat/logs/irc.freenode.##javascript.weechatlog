2019-01-24 19:35:19	jomofcw	Few years ago, I learn that the clicked submit button isn't always sent as parameters in the POST request (e.g. I click on the button "<button type="submit" name="addToCart" value="1">Add to cart</button>" and so it add the parameter "addToCart" having the value "1" to the POST parameters). Is it always right ? Or does it send the parameters in any case now ? Or never ? According to my

2019-01-24 22:56:05	stennowork	sinclair__, sure but react is webcomponents-like already
2019-01-24 22:56:16	sinclair__	stennowork: yeah, but its not really
2019-01-24 22:56:17	stennowork	sinclair__, so that would be a somewhat sensible transition
2019-01-24 22:56:25	sinclair__	stennowork: it is and it isn't
2019-01-24 22:56:30	wedr	"is foo not" is also weird zsoc
2019-01-24 22:56:33	zsoc	what if the semantics of "not foo" changes in the future? isNotFoo gives you the abstraction without refactoring
2019-01-24 22:56:45	sinclair__	the main issue is i can't just embed react components without doing a little dance
2019-01-24 22:56:46	wedr	wasFoo
2019-01-24 22:56:49	stennowork	zsoc, foo is boolean right?

2019-01-24 22:56:54	stennowork	eh
2019-01-24 22:57:03	wedr	who ever said foo is boolean?
2019-01-24 22:57:13	wedr	all I know, foo can be truthy/falsy
2019-01-24 22:57:17	pandem	something either is foo or is not foo, what other options are there?
2019-01-24 22:57:17	zsoc	^
2019-01-24 22:57:18	MJCD	wedr, whether it is or is not Foo is true/false

2019-01-24 22:59:40	jbr	Hi all. I'm looking for the proper way to add a client's "tracking pixel" tech to links. The key is that the click appends a <script> tag. Ideally that would happen synchronously: the tag loads and then the link behavior continues as expected. scripttag.onload would work except when an ad blocker is present. scripttag.onerror doesn't seem to fire in that case, either.

2019-01-25 00:38:28	ecmabot	jayjo: Modules divide programs into clusters of code that, by some criterion, belong together. "!es6 modules" are second-class, but JS can encode first-class ones. Major implementations include CommonJS, Node modules (a variant of CJS), and AMD. All of them can be used in any JS VM, including browsers. See also: http://robotlolita.me/2013/06/06/node-modules-to-rule-them-all.html and http://eloquentjavascript.net/10_modules.html.
2019-01-25 00:38:48	bradleymeck	!esm @ jayjo
2019-01-25 00:38:48	ecmabot	jayjo: ES2015 provides semantics for import/export (currently in modern browsers). node 8.5+, however, requires the --experimental-modules flag and .mjs files. !babel simply transpiles import/export to `require`. Use node-style CJS modules for now.

2019-01-25 02:09:35	ecmabot	jayjo: ES2015 provides semantics for import/export (currently in modern browsers). node 8.5+, however, requires the --experimental-modules flag and .mjs files. !babel simply transpiles import/export to `require`. Use node-style CJS modules for now.
2019-01-25 02:09:45	indomitable	MadLamb, yeah don't encourage me, it's frowned upon here
2019-01-25 02:09:54	wedr	indomitable: It's because I didn't make any "promises" to begin with.

2019-01-25 02:38:50	jayjo	I'm looking at the export docs for modules here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export#Module_Redirects and don't understand this part: If we want to export default, and star from another module (effectively creating a "redirect") `export {default} from './other-module'; export * from './other-module';` Does that just mean it will import that entire module
2019-01-25 02:38:56	jayjo	if you import it? Is that what a redirect means here? It's also confusing when they say "The following syntax does not export a default export from the imported module: `export * from ...`, if you need to export the default, write the following: `export {default} from 'mod';` -is this exporting a default from a *different* module?

2019-01-25 09:08:11	bradleymeck	i'm very confused about this whole thing, WASM still has a VM step and isn't exactly machine code
2019-01-25 09:08:12	sinclair__	devsnek: and the other thing that is nice about this is that because security could be controlled / sandboxed by some wasm execution context, then things built on it (html/css/js) would inheritate that security context
2019-01-25 09:08:34	bradleymeck	under the hood WASM and JS are very similar in intermediary operations (but not semantics)
2019-01-25 09:08:50	sinclair__	devsnek: and wasm would be WAY easier to sandbox than a mash of DOM/JS crap on top
2019-01-25 09:08:53	bradleymeck	also WASM shared pointers are much scarier for locking it down than JS

2019-01-25 09:12:51	bradleymeck	WASM isn't going to change a lot of the security ideas of w/e language is compiling to it
2019-01-25 09:13:00	ljharb	sinclair__: ok? literally zero of that is relevant to this entire conversation
2019-01-25 09:13:21	ljharb	sinclair__: other than that it's a barely related thing you're also very excited about
2019-01-25 09:13:37	devsnek	what about compiling wasm to wasm
2019-01-25 09:13:51	bradleymeck	WASM is exciting, but it isn't something that is setup to overtake other parts of the web anytime soon
2019-01-25 09:13:53	sinclair__	ljharb: im just explaining what Blazor is because you don't understand anything that ISNT JS
2019-01-25 09:14:03	devsnek	blazor is the jsx of c#
2019-01-25 09:14:16	Christofosho	I'll write whatever makes websites.
2019-01-25 09:14:25	sinclair__	ljharb: but outside of what it is 'specifically', to me it looks like the beginning of a trend.
2019-01-25 09:14:30	ljharb	sinclair__: ok. now that i understand what it is, it's irrelevant and i didn't need to understand it
2019-01-25 09:14:30	devsnek	well angular+jsx of c#
2019-01-25 09:14:35	bradleymeck	sinclair__: but thats just saying a language can now target browsers is the point, it isn't stating anything about being a suitable sandbox
2019-01-25 09:14:37	ljharb	sinclair__: maybe it is! that's not what we're talking about
2019-01-25 09:14:50	devsnek	sinclair__: the trend of large companies putting effort and resources into using wasm?
2019-01-25 09:14:52	ljharb	sinclair__: even if *every single piece of content on the internet* ended up written in wasm, it wouldn't necessitate the changes we've been discussing
2019-01-25 09:15:24	bradleymeck	WASM does have some very nice security properties, but also some that are not as nice

2019-01-25 09:16:09	devsnek	bradleymeck: we never should have added the `sudo.sandwich` instruction
2019-01-25 09:16:15	sinclair__	ljharb: i mean, think about Adobe or Unity

2019-01-25 09:16:30	bradleymeck	sinclair__: unlikely, due to how browser sandboxing exists today and IPC based bindings they would never be allows such low level access

2019-01-25 09:16:48	ljharb	photoshop already runs native in the browser, on adobe.com or whatever

2019-01-25 09:17:35	brandonkal	anyone here use flow?
2019-01-25 09:17:43	bradleymeck	exposing things as bindings/first class values makes a lot of the current multi-proc browser infrastructures break

2019-01-25 16:05:35	spinningCat	is this what you meant synthmeat ?
2019-01-25 16:05:40	synthmeat	ya, that'll return object {..}
2019-01-25 16:05:51	spinningCat	 i see
2019-01-25 16:06:00	spinningCat	this is like immediate execution right
2019-01-25 16:06:10	ljharb	spinningCat: an arrow function has two forms. `=> {…}` means the curlies contain statements, and `=> anything else` means "Return that expression`
2019-01-25 16:06:13	ljharb	spinningCat: no
2019-01-25 16:06:23	ljharb	spinningCat: the expression is evaluated every time the function is called
2019-01-25 16:06:40	cdunklau	spinningCat: in some contexts, {} is a block of code instead of an object literal
2019-01-25 16:06:48	spinningCat	$function({ .. })() is it similar to that from jquery?
2019-01-25 16:06:55	cdunklau	in those contexts, if you actually want an object literal, you need to do ({})
2019-01-25 16:06:59	ljharb	spinningCat: no, not in any way
2019-01-25 16:07:04	spinningCat	I see
2019-01-25 16:07:16	synthmeat	() makes stuff an expression, right?
2019-01-25 16:07:21	cdunklau	yes

2019-01-25 16:10:15	cdunklau	although we're getting an assignment expression in py 3.8 :/  thankfully it's different syntax, not changing the semantics of =

2019-01-25 16:11:08	spinningCat	x = 5
2019-01-25 16:11:12	markh	spinningCat, you could do something like let x = () => 2 + 3 ;

2019-01-25 16:12:27	spinningCat	thanks cdunklau
2019-01-25 16:12:29	markh	so because that's an implied return you're saying return "x = 3 + 5"
2019-01-25 16:12:49	cdunklau	but if you return an object from a literal, you _must_ use the parens, because of the syntax ambiguity

2019-01-25 16:13:53	spinningCat	can you be more spesific
2019-01-25 16:13:57	spinningCat	i couldnt parse that
2019-01-25 16:14:13	cdunklau	markh: 1) using assignment as an expression, and 2) assigning to a global var
2019-01-25 16:14:27	cdunklau	spinningCat: remember how i said {} means two things?
2019-01-25 16:14:31	cdunklau	block of code, and object literal?
2019-01-25 16:14:33	markh	oh, i may have missed part of the question
2019-01-25 16:14:53	cdunklau	markh: it makes *syntactic* sense, but it doesn't make actual sense to do
2019-01-25 16:14:58	spinningCat	yes
2019-01-25 16:15:25	cdunklau	spinningCat: the parser needs to be able to decide with *certainty* which one to choose

2019-01-25 16:17:33	cdunklau	spinningCat: usually it's clear which is which, but since arrow functions are so terse, it can be ambiguous
2019-01-25 16:18:06	cdunklau	you can either do () => <expression>, and you get the implicit return, or () => <block>, and must be explicit about the return

2019-01-25 16:33:17	cdunklau	spinningCat: so you do `let str = "";`. this defines a variable `str`, and also makes it refer to a string object (primative actually but that's not important)
2019-01-25 16:33:43	sinclair__	synthmeat: i suppose, with async iterators in the works for nodejs streams this is liable to be less of a problem in future, but it amazes me how so much stuff gets written over these async / event driven interfaces
2019-01-25 16:33:58	cdunklau	spinningCat: then later you do `str = str + "a";`. this does the right side first, concatenating the two string objects and making a new one
2019-01-25 16:34:08	synthmeat	sinclair__: yeah. but there's languages that work better as glue in the way you describe
2019-01-25 16:34:13	sinclair__	synthmeat: with node worker threads, i don't think its too unreasonable to imagine blocking in node

2019-01-25 09:38:35	mannyp	Hi there. I'm pretty guilty lately of using arrow functions all over the place. I know this can be bad since it's confusing in stack traces. As a rule of thumb, should I perhaps strive to use function foo()... in every case where I strictly don't need to preserve `this` context?

2019-01-25 09:42:53	androi	some troubles with react.. still at the beginning.. there are not only individual properties, but also included internal ones? so you could declare own ones like <Component prop={var} />.. or using internals like the "children" property.. is that right?
2019-01-25 09:42:57	synthmeat	ah, the old case of "did you even try to run it". i'm guilty here too. cargo cult ftw. thanks, igemnace

2019-01-25 09:49:23	hello_kitty	i think maybe firefox is losing my mousemove and mousedown events b/c it seems to care more about what is under the mouse than chrome/edge... so document.addEventListener('mousedown', etc) might not universally work...

2019-01-25 10:46:22	MJCD_	they do have policies against malicious content on npm, so such a thing would be quite short lived tbh
2019-01-25 10:46:33	MJCD_	a good reason to use official npm repo's not third party ones
2019-01-25 10:46:51	RLa	on github it's with or without prefix/postfix but on npm it's exact opposite

2019-01-25 10:54:17	darkSeid	MJCD_ that's not true is it
2019-01-25 10:54:51	MJCD_	if you want the CURRENT value you should just do button.innerText
2019-01-25 10:54:57	darkSeid	the docs https://jestjs.io/docs/en/mock-functions give an example of mocking axios
2019-01-25 10:54:59	MJCD_	inside the function

2019-01-25 10:55:14	darkSeid	but I don't think you can do that because it doesn't until its generated at runtime or something
2019-01-25 10:55:15	MJCD_	darkSeid, did you read the documentation I linked?
2019-01-25 10:55:36	MJCD_	"Amazon API Gateway supports mock integrations for API methods. This feature enables API developers to generate API responses from API Gateway directly,"
2019-01-25 10:55:42	MJCD_	Aka, you don't even have to mock it yourself
2019-01-25 10:55:46	MJCD_	^_^
2019-01-25 10:55:55	darkSeid	yeah, it's not really what I was looking for I don't think?
2019-01-25 10:56:12	darkSeid	Maybe it is and I'm not following along, but I'm talking about mocking the aws-sdk
2019-01-25 10:56:13	MJCD_	that's the official way they provide for this kind of testing
2019-01-25 10:56:18	MJCD_	but *shrug*
2019-01-25 10:56:32	MJCD_	and I know you are, this just uses a different api subdomain
2019-01-25 10:56:42	darkSeid	I don't see how that helps if I need to mock something like ec2
2019-01-25 10:56:44	stennowork	spinningCat, so you want to get innerText from the click event?
2019-01-25 10:57:19	darkSeid	if i need to mock something like `AWS.EC2.stopInstances()` I'm not sure how that link relates to that? I may be missing something tbh
2019-01-25 10:57:19	spinningCat	yeah i try to learn react i can get state of commponent and pass it as prob etc.
2019-01-25 10:57:28	spinningCat	if it does make sense i am kinda new
2019-01-25 10:57:33	spinningCat	try to learn stuff
2019-01-25 10:57:41	MJCD_	you would do it identically to how you would normally do it
2019-01-25 10:58:04	MJCD_	just instead you connect to mock.aws.whatever not real.aws.whatever
2019-01-25 10:58:14	MJCD_	it allows you to specify the type of response you would like
2019-01-25 10:58:42	MJCD_	and in all else behaves identically to a real, say, ec2, instance
2019-01-25 10:58:50	darkSeid	right but when I do that I get an error that `AWS.EC2.stopInstances` and I think it has something to do with that function being dynamically generated at runtime

Sometimes he's getting an error that the function isn't defined, but it works perfectly for me.

2019-01-25 16:34:13	zsoc	The point is that even if you don't want to "keep the other collection" *now*, you don't have to consider whether you're "keeping" it or not, if you don't mutate it
2019-01-25 16:34:20	darkSeid	graingert I took out the logic for creating an ec2 instance into its own module, not sure I've done it correctly though. I mean it _works_, but it has 3 params and I think I may not be doing this correctly
2019-01-25 16:34:38	zsoc	It's less cognitive overhead to not have to consider if you've mutated some thing or other at all times... because you are in the habit of not mutating anything unless absolutely necessary

2019-01-25 16:52:21	MJCD_	zsoc, ydkjs is more practical/hands on

2019-01-25 16:52:34	MJCD_	right, it's more advanced
2019-01-25 16:52:40	DeltaHeavy	Eloquent JavaScript teaches you JS as a programming language. Not as a language to power web UIs
2019-01-25 16:52:40	darkSeid	you can't learn to code just from reading a book
2019-01-25 16:52:43	zsoc	and mdn tutorials are like .. no - not only aren't they good but also they suggest using things like the express-generator :p
2019-01-25 16:52:47	DeltaHeavy	Eloquent JavaScript is meant for beginners
2019-01-25 16:52:49	darkSeid	you've got to build stuff and read bits and pieces along the way
2019-01-25 16:53:01	darkSeid	DeltaHeavy it's tough for beginners tbh
2019-01-25 16:53:03	DeltaHeavy	darkSeid Well you read the book AND do that. Eloquent even has exercises and mini-projects
2019-01-25 16:53:17	DeltaHeavy	Eh, it's meant for beginners. It breaks down what programming even is in the beginning.
2019-01-25 16:53:19	jayjo	are there well-known migration guides to es6 syntax? Primarily should I just switch every instance of 'var' to 'let' ?
2019-01-25 16:53:20	darkSeid	right, but I don't think that's how it actually works
2019-01-25 16:53:22	jayjo	at a minimum?
2019-01-25 16:53:24	MJCD_	zsoc, they don't recommend any such thing - however it can be a very useful tool for learning the basic structures generally adopted

2019-01-25 16:53:41	darkSeid	I think most people read a bit, try to build something. You then get sidetracked, learn something completely different. Maybe you go back to that book later or something

Dot notation is preferred to bracket notation except where the property name would be an invalid identifier. The same applies to quoting keys inside object literals - don't do it unless you have to.

2019-01-26 00:31:54	ecmabot	ljharb: `var` defines a variable in the current function-level scope, and should not be used when `const` or `let` are available (see !babel, !const, and !let). Always use a keyword to declare variables, otherwise you will pollute the global scope (a keyword is required in strict mode).

2019-01-26 00:55:40	ljharb	so my advice is, do thing in this order: 1) use only promises. no chaining. no await. every .then makes a new variable. 2) combine things that depend on each other into chains. 3) start using `await` and `Promise.all` as needed

2019-01-26 00:57:37	graingert	async await is promises

2019-01-26 00:57:44	DeltaHeavy	Dirak They *ARE* promises. async ensure a function always returns one, await is an alternative to Promise.prototype.then
2019-01-26 00:57:45	graingert	you mean .then(fn)
2019-01-26 00:58:01	DeltaHeavy	Dirak Also I rarely use await.

2019-01-26 00:58:26	Dirak	No, Promises, are promises and async/await is async/await. Implementation wise they are promises, but syntax-wise they're different
