2019-01-30 13:38:05	davidv7	@phisch#3915 is there any C# plugin you've used? i dont want to install rider just for a quick read of someone elses code
2019-01-30 13:46:03	phisch	@davidv7#2315 thats webstorm, that theme would work for all jetbrains ui's
2019-01-30 13:46:12	davidv7	oh thats cool i installed
2019-01-30 13:46:12	phisch	i don't do c# code though
2019-01-30 13:46:21	phisch	c# is for plebs
2019-01-30 13:46:38	davidv7	he just wants me to comment on a few things before he starts applying for jobs ¯\(ツ)/¯
2019-01-30 13:47:06	phisch	let him upload that on github
2019-01-30 13:47:20	phisch	this is the best way to do codereviews and comment on code
2019-01-30 13:47:58	davidv7	how come? i probably wont be opening issues
2019-01-30 13:48:42	davidv7	i was mostly just gonna either talk to him over discord over like voice chat and tell him stuff like "yeah the naming scheme in line 39 and 55 doesnt fit the rest of the codebase"
2019-01-30 13:48:44	davidv7	shit like that
2019-01-30 13:49:08	davidv7	i dont think i'll be able to find any REAL issues since i dont know the language nor the unity environment
2019-01-30 13:49:08	phisch	oh oh, thats fine too
2019-01-30 13:49:18	phisch	other than that: https://github.com/features/code-review/
