2019-01-04 01:52:18	Kazakhstani_borat	Yo any of you play MHW?
2019-01-04 04:53:13	KingPhantom3	I would, but it's Windows only.....
2019-01-04 04:53:16	KingPhantom3	üò¢
2019-01-04 04:53:32	KingPhantom3	Looks pretty cool, though.
2019-01-04 06:23:36	Kazakhstani_borat	wine?
2019-01-04 06:24:49	Butterscotch	I've had better luck with proton.
2019-01-04 06:26:22	Kazakhstani_borat	fair
2019-01-04 08:30:28	Arch	I've been running Heroes of the Storm and Starcraft 2 with lutris. Pretty flawless. Really happy with witcher 3 in proton now too.
2019-01-04 09:37:04	Astrak	proton is wine
2019-01-04 10:04:09	Vitre	Wine is not an emulator.
2019-01-04 10:04:28	Aresiel	üëç
2019-01-04 18:21:11	Arch	The main binary of proton is wine, yes. But it has many additional featuresthat vanilla wine doesn't have. I can't pacman -S wine and have it working out of the box with dxvk and esync without doing any configuration.
2019-01-04 20:07:53	GibPancakes	you could if someone put Wine compiled with esync patchset and dxvk instead of wined3d11 into your favorite Arch's repo.
2019-01-04 20:17:44	Vitre	And that's called Proton !
2019-01-04 20:19:15	GibPancakes	if Proton's so great, then why is there no Proton 2?
2019-01-04 20:19:38	Aresiel	dun
2019-01-04 20:19:39	Aresiel	dun
2019-01-04 20:19:39	Aresiel	duuuuun
2019-01-04 20:20:39	GibPancakes	I think Proton should be available outside Steam, too.
2019-01-04 20:21:12	GibPancakes	and maybe extended with even mooaarr libraries bound to their Linux native equivalents.
2019-01-04 20:21:32	GibPancakes	for example, Proton has own Wine libraries for steam_api libraries.
2019-01-04 20:22:06	GibPancakes	you know, libraries which programs running in Wine load and call as if they were normal Windows ones, but in reality they're Linux ones.
2019-01-04 23:52:04	Astrak	proton is available outside steam
2019-01-04 23:52:27	Astrak	i'll grab the link
